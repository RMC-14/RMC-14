  description: A set of civilian-style brown vest and orange pants. The material is surprisingly decent, something not often worn by the civilians of the SPP for two reasons. They typically can't afford such clothing, and if they can, it paints a target on their back.

  name: "Chǎnyè Combine mining overalls"
  description: "A durable, olive-green jumpsuit worn beneath a sleeveless, puffy orange work vest—standard issue for Chǎnyè Combine laborers. The vest's faded fabric is lined with reinforced padding, offering minimal protection against workplace hazards. A red star insignia is stamped on the back, marking its wearer as part of the Combine’s industrial workforce. Stiff, uncomfortable, and mass-produced, but better than nothing in the unforgiving conditions of deep-space labor."
