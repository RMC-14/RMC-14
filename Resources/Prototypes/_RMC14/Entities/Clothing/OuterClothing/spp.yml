  description: Standard body armor of the SPP military, the UM5 (Union Medium MK5) is a medium body armor, roughly on par with the M3 pattern body armor in service with the UNMC, specialized towards ballistics protection. Unlike the M3, however, the plate has a heavier neckplate. This has earned many UN members to refer to SPP soldiers as 'tin men'.
