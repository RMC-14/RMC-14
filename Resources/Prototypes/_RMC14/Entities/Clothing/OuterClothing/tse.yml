  name: paramarine combat jacket
  description: A rugged, all-weather combat jacket issued to the RCM's Paramarine regiments. Designed for versatility, it serves as both a field garment and a lightweight layer of protection. Reinforced with ballistic fibers and treated for weather resistance, it offers limited defense against shrapnel and small arms fire while keeping Paramarines comfortable in harsh conditions. Its deep green color and durable fabric make it a staple for both active deployment and off-duty wear.
