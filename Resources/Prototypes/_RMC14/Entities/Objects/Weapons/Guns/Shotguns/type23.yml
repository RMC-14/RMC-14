  id: RMCWeaponShotgunType23
  description: As SPP soldiers frequently reported being outmatched by enemy combatants, SPP High Command commissioned a large amount of Type 23 shotguns, originally used for quelling defector colony riots. This slow semi-automatic shotgun chambers 8 gauge, and packs a mean punch.
