    delay: 0.2 # TODO RMC14 Make some way for rockets to explode when they stop, for shooting at the ground closer than max range.
    # This is a temporary hack to guarantee it will always go off after stopping even if it doesn't collide with anything.
    # Works for almost all gameplay purposes at least right now because even max range rockets are less than 0.2s and it's fast enough not matter.
