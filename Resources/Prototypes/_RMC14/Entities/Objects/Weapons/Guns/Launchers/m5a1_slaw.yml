  description: The M5A1 SLAW is a lightweight one-shot anti-armor weapon capable of engaging enemy vehicles at ranges up to 1,000m. Fully disposable, the rocket's launcher is discarded after firing. When stowed, the SLAW system consists of a watertight carbon-fiber composite blast tube, inside of which is an aluminum launch tube containing the missile. The weapon is fired by pushing a charge button on the trigger grip. It is sighted and fired from the shoulder.
