  description: M74 - Airburst Grenade Munition - Fragmentation. This grenade must be launched with a grenade launcher, and detonates once it reaches its destination. It disperses jagged shrapnel in a cone in front of itself, tearing through sinews and armor alike. Dispersion pattern is optimized against large target. Suffers from overpenetration on a direct hit.

  name: HIRR baton slug
  description: Cousin to the M15 Rubber pellet, the HIRR baton slug was recalled from military and civilian police forces due to over-packed propellant in the sabot casing. Now it is utilized as a less-than-lethal option in engagements with human, and sometimes non-human, forces. Historically, the HIRR was incredibly popular during the Arcturus conflict, as the impact force was found to reliably incapacitate Arcturian resistance forces by breaking their ribs into their lungs.
