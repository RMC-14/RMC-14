  description: A top-break revolver used by the Extrasolar Imperial Airborne Force’s 24th Para Regiment, and sometimes seen in the hands of other TSE military forces. Fires .44 Magnum. Archaic, yes, but brutally effective. Vacuum-sealed internals, Bakelite-style grips, and a recoil like getting kicked by a mule. Still puts things down Hard.
