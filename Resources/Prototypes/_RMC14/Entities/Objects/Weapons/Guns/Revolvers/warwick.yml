  description: A top-break revolver used by the RCM’s Paramarine regiments, and sometimes seen in the hands of other TSE military forces. Fires .44 Magnum. Archaic, yes, but brutally effective. Vacuum-sealed internals, Bakelite-style grips, and a recoil like getting kicked by a mule. Still puts things down Hard.
