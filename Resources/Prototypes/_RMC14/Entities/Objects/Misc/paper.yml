        Almayer Command,
        Your mission today is of great importance. As relayed via your announcement frequency, the UNS Amast, which was transporting a phoron-based experimental weapon of Aegis Armaments manufacture, suddenly and unexpectedly landed in your operational area. Any attempts to hail the Amast, or the colony, has been met with radio silence. Second company, you are the closest marines able to respond to this situation, and so we call on you.

        We require you to recover the experimental weapon from the suspected landing site of the Amast at all costs. Should this weapon fall into enemy hands, it could result in a catastrophe unlike any other. We have instructed your ARES instance to create a encrypted key that will allow you to unlock the secure crate the weapon is transported in, which will arrive via your ASRS shortly.

        Due to the extreme weight of the weapon, it requires a power assisted loading exosuit to be moved. You will need to utilize the key to unlock the crate in order to move the weapon, as it is far to heavy for a common power loader. We have also instructed your ASRS to supply you with a power loading manual for use with any one of your marines.

        The crate the weapon resides in is extremely durable, and should stand up to anything you throw at it short of a orbital bombardment. Ensure the weapon is either used, or remains in one piece, do not let it be destroyed.

        Once the cargo is recovered, you are permitted to utilize the experimental weapon at will for the purposes of data collection on its effectiveness for Aegis. To this end, a software update has been remotely installed to your orbital bombardment cannon console to allow for use of the experimental weapon, with the cannon as its delivery method. If fired at an great enough obstacle, Almayer will be transferred tech points for the data that was automatically collected from the results.

        You are to use extreme caution should you choose to utilize this weapon, it is far more powerful than any other armament used on the Almayer prior. A secondary transport ship better equipped to handle such a weapon will arrive shortly after your operation commences, if use of the weapon is not needed.

        Good luck Falling Falcons, we are counting on you. Semper Fi, and god bless the UN.

        Signed,

        Almayer Command,
        Your mission today is of great importance. As relayed via your announcement frequency, the UNS Amast, which was transporting a experimental phoron-based weapon of Aegis Armaments manufacture, suddenly and unexpectedly landed in your operational area. Any attempts to hail the Amast, or the colony, has been met with radio silence. Second company, you are the closest marines able to respond to this situation, and so we call on you.

        We require you to recover the experimental weapon from the suspected landing site of the Amast at all costs. Should this weapon fall into enemy hands, it could give away decades of top secret weapons research, cutting down the UNMC's technological advantage over our potential enemies by a significant amount. Additionally, you should endeavor to ensure the colony, and its residents, are safe. For all intensive purposes, ignoring the recovery of the weapon, treat this mission as though it where a standard distress call.

        Radio transponders from the secure crate the weapon is transported in indicate it remains squarely in your operational area, with no signs of movement. Its exact position has been marked on your tactical map. Unfortunately, it is not as simple as just retrieving the crate. The crate is far too heavy to move with any tools at your disposal, and thus you will need to unlock it to transport the weapon itself.

        To do this, you will require a encrypted key card likely in the possession of the head scientist of the Amast at the time of the crash. We have instructed your ARES instance to tune a advanced radio signal pinpointing device to the specialized frequency of the identification card to help you locate and secure it. The pinpointer should arrive via your ASRS lift shortly.

        Due to the extreme weight of the weapon, it requires a power assisted loading exosuit to be moved once the crate is unlocked. We have also instructed your ASRS to supply you with a power loading manual to train any one of your marines to operate a power loader.

        The crate the weapon resides in is extremely durable, and should stand up to anything you, or any other threats in the operating area, throw at it short of a orbital bombardment. Ensure the weapon is either used, or remains in one piece, its destruction is not a acceptable outcome.

        Once the cargo is recovered, you are permitted to utilize the experimental weapon at will for the purposes of data collection on its effectiveness for Aegis. To this end, a software update has been remotely installed to your orbital bombardment cannon console to allow for use of the experimental weapon, with the cannon as its delivery method. 

        Aegis Armaments has also assured us that the UNMC will be deservedly compensated upon recovery of the weapon and the key card, as well as for any usage data we may acquire. We have decided a portion of this compensation will be allocated to the Almayer in the form of additional tech points. We will provide these tech points upon recovery of the weapon and key card, as well as upon usage of the device. ARES will handle relaying any data in regards to its effectiveness to us, however should you have any comments or concerns, please include them in your standard after action reports.

        You are to use extreme caution should you choose to utilize this weapon, it is far more powerful than any other armament used on the Almayer prior. A transport ship better equipped to handle such a weapon will arrive within a week after your operation commences, if use of the weapon is not needed.

        Good luck Falling Falcons, we are counting on you. Semper Fi, and god bless the UN.
