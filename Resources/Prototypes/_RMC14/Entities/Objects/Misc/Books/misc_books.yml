Despite the publisher's warning that this novel is clearly fiction, there's something in the terrified, frantic prose which makes it seem more real. The Author is unknown.

  name: "Dark Light: The Painful Day"
  description: Oh god. This book centres around an 'ancient conflict' between Vampires and Werewolves, but it's really just a thousand or so pages of edgy prose which has the emotional depth of a swimming pool, a main vampire character so bland he's not much more then a cardboard cutout, and werewolves so stupid the plot itself becomes an incomprehensible sludge. Written by The Fruit of Solace.

  description: A book on the incredibly fringe theory regarding the existence of "Advanced Quasi-Dimensional Anodic Pseduo-Sine Waves", which the author claims is a state of sound in which various factors such as beats, constructive and deconstructive phases, and amplitude combine to produce a Supra-natural effect on the world. Some effects include breaking into frantic dance, being unable to forget the tune, and entering a state of ego-death. The prose seems over-eager and hyped up. Written by DJ. Switzwald Giessen.
