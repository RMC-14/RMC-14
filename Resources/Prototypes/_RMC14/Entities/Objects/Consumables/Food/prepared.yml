  name: "Marine 'X-MAS' Meal: Sugar Cookies"
  description: The UNMC M25 Sugar Cookies Meal was designed to give marines a feeling of Christmas joy. But to the bemusement of superior officers, the costs-savings measure of simply fabricating protein bars in the shape of cookies with chocolate substitute chips and the replacement of the expected milk with artificially colored water did not go over well with most marines.

  description: The UNMC M25 Gingerbread Cookies Meal was designed to give marines convenient and cheap access to gingerbread cookies as a replacement for annual gingerbread making classes due to rising expenses and comically low success rates for the Basic Holidays Festivities Course. However, due to cost saving measures, these cookies seldom inspire happiness, nor holiday spirit.
