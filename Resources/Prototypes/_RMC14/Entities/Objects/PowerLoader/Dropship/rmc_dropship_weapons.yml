  name: GAU-21 30mm cannon
  description: A dismounted GAU-21 'Rattler' 30mm rotary cannon. It seems to be missing its feed links and has exposed connection wires. Capable of firing 5200 rounds a minute, feared by many for its power. Earned the nickname 'Rattler' from the vibrations it would cause on dropships in its initial production run. Accepts PGU-100/PGU-105 ammo crates
