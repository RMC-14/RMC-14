# Sound Markers
# Currently these use TimedDespawn to remove themselves after playing their sound, but you have to manually change the despawn time to sync up with the sound length
# which is utterly cancerous so i beg someone to make a component that does this automatically
# you have my life whoever does this - cro
# for now just make the timed despawn equal to the sound length + 0.1 seconds so it doesnt get cut off awkwardly - also cro
