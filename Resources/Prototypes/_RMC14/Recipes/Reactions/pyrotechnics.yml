#TODO sensitivity threshold
#if created volume > sensitivity threshold, volatiles triggered
#if sensitivity threshold is equal to zero, it should act like potassium + water
#theorhetically, water should negate the effective of volatiles
#but only if you have an amount of water that is greater than or equal to the volatile chemical.

#TODO sensitivity threshold = 60.01
