# Marine Tips
  - "Pilots: there is one of each engine upgrade in the hangar at the start of the round, saving you the point cost of having to print out a pair of each."
  - "You can put screwdrivers, cigarettes, and some other things in your second ear slot!"
  - "By right clicking storage items, you can change their on-click behavior, such as clicking to take a magazine from a belt."
  - "You can grab items from second-level storage, such as a bandage in a first aid kit stored inside a satchel."
  - "CPR extends the defib timer on dead marines. It can be done by clicking the dead marine with an open hand. Make sure to get the rhythm correct!"
  - "Flamethrowers! Green fire is weak but has a lot of utility, such as melting through armor and being instantly extinguishable. Queens and Ravagers are flameproof. Most flamethrower damage comes from the initial burst, not the flame on the ground. Don't forget you can have an underbarrel extinguisher."
  - "You can carry a variety of items inside your helmet - from gauze and cigarettes to flares and screwdrivers."
  - "The amount of items in Requisitions and Squad Preparations depend on how many players readied up at the start of the round."
  - "The XO and CO are trained in Power Loader use and engineering, and can load the OB."
  - "A misloaded OB can deviate severely from the intended target area - ensure you load them correctly!"
  - "Escape pods are designed for only three occupants - more than that, or if a larger xenonid is in the pod, and it will malfunction and blow up on launch."
  - "Holocards are a useful triage tool for doctors and medics. Ensure you assign them (examine the marine with shift-click and select an appropriate holocard) to marines who have taken damage that cannot be healed without surgery."
  - "Medical can make pressurized canister pouches, which can contain a large amount reagents, and contain custom injectors."
  - "Resin structures are weaker to melee than they are to bullets. Take out your knives!"
  - "You can hold a bayonet or throwing knife on your mask slot."
  - "If your weapon has a bayonet, you can manually pry open unpowered doors by clicking on them with the gun. Click on the door again to close it."
  - "If another marine is stunned, you can click on them with an open hand to shake them up faster."
  - "The Orbital Bombardment is always closer than it looks."
  - "Vary your loadout! Doing the same thing every round gets old fast. Try out the pistols, or carry flares."
  - "Orbital Bombardment warheads respect roofing and hive core protection. They won't hit inside of protected areas."
  - "ARES will periodically report the amount of available tech points on Command Channel."
  - "clicking the Squad Leader tracker lets you track your fireteam leader instead."
  - "If you've been pounced on and your squad is unloading into the target, you can 'rest' to stay down so you don't get filled with lead after getting up."
  - "Armor piercing ammunition does less damage to unarmored targets."
  - "You can find breaching charges in Requisitions or the Squad Engineer vendor. They function like C4, but can be deployed and explode much quicker, and release powerful shrapnel on the opposite side. They require minor engineering knowledge, which can be obtained from pamphlets."
  - "To check your skills, examine yourself, and click the cap."
  - "A ‘point blank’ or ‘PB’ is a type of attack with a firearm where you click directly on a mob next to you. These attacks are not effected by accuracy allowing you to quickly fire with weapons like a shotgun to great effect."
  - "The area indicator what area you are in, on the map."
  - "You can weld barricades to repair them."
  - "When pushing into a room/choke point, move aside immediately after passing the door/choke point, allowing following squadmates to move in and fire"

  - "A single Xeno will almost always win against a single marine"
  - "If nobody sees you die, nobody will try to rescue you. Never go alone if you can help it."
  - "Don’t stand still when you’re near an active front. Standing still leaves you vulnerable to warrior grabs, lurker and runner pounces, oppressor hooks, acid spit and vomit, and more."
  - "Remember, if you don't see anything, there is a Lurker there. If you don't have direct line of sight, there is a Lurker there. If you see an open cade, a Lurker has gone through there."
  - "Light and vision are vital to your success, and also your greatest weakness."
  - "Most guns takes two hands to shoot properly. If fired in one hand, the accuracy will be severely reduced, and recoil and spread is greatly increased, meaning that you would have a hard time hitting the target with it. To wield it with both hands, click on the rifle in your active hand (Z)."
  - "If you hear a long beeping sound, you are probably out of ammo."
  - "Bring rollerbeds to ferry unconscious marines out of the front lines."

  - "Build barricades with marines standing one tile behind in mind."
  - "It is much safer to build barricades on the backline then push it to the front."
  - "You don't always need a mega FOB!"
  - "Use materials wisely. Metal and plasteel are expensive."
  - "If you want a marine to move out of your way, point at them (shift + middle click) and ask them to move. Catch up if you fall behind and ask the squad to wait; wait if you went ahead."
  - "Watch others positions and firing lanes, don't move into their firing lanes and stop shooting when others move into yours."
  - "Never get captured! Go out with a bang! If you get captured you will be another egg for the Xenos."

  - "You can climb over fences."
  - "Watch out for friendly fire. Make sure you're not walking into anyone's firing line, and make sure no one else is in yours!"

  - "Check perma-dead marines (skull icon on medhud) for useful gear, such as webbings, AP ammo, or binoculars. Avoid taking from revivable marines though!"
  - "Always check for traps beneath loose objects - it could save your life!"
  - "Bring a fire extinguisher, it might just save someone's life. They can remove flames that block a push, remove acid from other marines, as well as put out people on fire."
  - "Trading your life for a Xenonid's is almost always worth it."
  - "No round has ever been won behind a barricade. Apart from the ones that have."

  - "More dakka is not good when it is directed towards your teammates."
  - "An FOB is as strong as its weakest part. Secure all flanks, remember that walls can be pried open."
  - "If the main push is stagnating and the area is congested, try to coordinate with a few others and go to a different area."
  - "When pushing into an area, check the flanks. Especially so in caves."
  - "Scavenging attachments (or other things) from dead marines isn't bad practice, as long as you make sure they're actually dead first."
  - "When receiving a supply crate drop from requisitions, make sure to move the crate before opening it - Otherwise subsequent supply crates will be hidden beneath it!"
  - "You can use a hand labeler (as found in squad prep rooms) to name your equipment and make it less likely to be stolen."
  - "CIC staff can track every Marine-aligned person via the suit sensors console and overwatch console - useful for finding escaped prisoners or dead marines."
  - "Remember that you need to put a defibrillator's paddles away in order to store it."
  - "We-Ya PMCs do not have marine IFF. Don't fire Smart Guns at them!"
  - "To talk on multiple radio channels at once, add up to four prefixes after the semicolon ':'. E.g, :abcd talks on the main four squad channels at once."
  - "Minirockets pack the most punch per cost as far as CAS weaponry is concerned."
  - "The underbarrel shotgun can instantly break down both resin doors and mechanical airlocks, and it's not bad at breaking walls down either."
  - "Requisitions may not grant you service if you are a 'pajamarine' (a marine in cryosleep attire). Be sure to dress up!"
  - "Don't underestimate the mortar! with ammo and proper communication it can hit surprisingly hard."

  - "You can put a pistol belt on your suit slot. (Just grab a rifle instead.)"
  - "Need help learning the game and these tips aren't enough? Use MentorHelp or try to get ahold of your ship's Senior Enlisted Advisor."
  #- "Both foldable cades & plasteel cades if loosened and folded down can be transported in crates! In this way, you can use the crate as a portable breach-repair kit, or dragged (or carried via Power Loader) to an unsecure area for quick defensive set up."
  #- "The fuel tank pouch doesn't just carry fuel for an incinerator- they can also carry full-size extinguishers. Toolbelts & tool pouches also may hold miniature extinguishers."
  #- "The M2C heavy machine gunner belt rig can also carry C4, breaching charges, and most tools."
  - "You can always multitask as Medic, such as by using pills or healing kits at the same time as defibrillator."
  #- "The nuclear ordnance requires BOTH communication towers to be actively held to decrypt the nuclear codes."
  - "Be careful when firing an Orbital Bombardment, Close Air Support, or the Mortar. Make sure you're not about to blow up the entire marine push."
  - "Never inject a marine you haven't scanned! You might overdose them; ESPECIALLY so with an emergency autoinjector."
  - "Any marine can perform CPR. On dead marines, this will increase the time they have until they become unrevivable."
  - "Boilers emit light - not every glow from around the corner is friendly!"
# Xeno Tips
  - "Acid traps can be sneakily placed next to a door in order to surprise marines."
  - "Xenonid structures like clusters, walls, or pillars are vital to your victory, be it as cover or to delay and funnel marines."
  - "Always thank your drones and Hivelords for supporting the hive!"

  - "Try out new castes or strains that you might have passed up initially. You might find them to be surprisingly fun."
  - "Pouncing or lunging into a marine that's almost offscreen is not very wise. A marine with a shotgun may be right next to them."
  - "Most Xenonid deaths are caused by over-aggression, especially off weeds. Rein yourself in, or you may find yourself dying round after round."
  - "You can spit at or shoot a welding fuel tank to blow it up next to hostiles."
  - "Quickly rest if you're right next to an explosive about to blow, you'll absorb half the explosion damage. The same method can be used to avoid shrapnel from certain explosion types."
  - "Unpowered shutters can be manually opened by clicking on them. The Queen can also open containment shutters, but this takes some time."
  #- "Moving through pipes is noisy and entering/leaving the vents has a noticeable visual and auditory cue."
  - "If a fellow Xenonid is stunned, be sure to drag them to safety."
  #- "Frenzy increases your speed and damage, Recovery increases your health regeneration, and Warding increases the time you have until you bleed out in critical health."
  - "Remember that, as a Xenonid, you can fully disable your night-vision. This helps put into perspective how hidden your position is to marines onscreen."
  #- "You can devour burst corpses in order to transport them to the Spawn Pool or Egg Morpher easier."
  - "The bigger you are, the more time it'll take to enter a tunnel."
  #- "Drag yourself onto a hole in a wall as a medium-sized or smaller Xeno to pass through it."
  #- "Claymores have directional explosions. Set them off early by slashing them from behind."
  - "If you have difficulty clicking marines, try using Directional Slashing, though there's no directional slashing for abilities."
  #- "You can diagonally pounce through the corners of fire as a Lurker or Runner without getting ignited."
  #- "As Xeno, you can break Night-Vision goggles that some marines wear on their helmets. Just aim for the head and slash until the goggles shatter."
  #- "Pounces are ineffective on marines who are laying down."
  - "Pouncing someone who is buckled to a chair will still stun them, but they will not be knocked to the ground."
  - "Star shell dust from said grenades is just as meltable as normal flares."
  - "Playable Parasites can leap onto targets with a windup, but this will only infect them if they are adjacent to it.  Otherwise, it will simply knock them down for a small duration."

  - "After dying, ask yourself what you did wrong and make a mental note to not make the same mistake again."
  - "Communication, be it from a marine to a marine, a drone to the queen, or command to everyone, is vital and information on flanks can change how the entire round plays out."

  - "Half of getting good is knowing to be aggressive. The other half is knowing when not to be aggressive."
  - "Use 'North, South, West, East' when referring to locations in-game rather than 'up, down, left, right'."
#  - "As a mentor, you can become the imaginary friend of a new player to teach them!"
  - "You shouldn't ignore what your allies are up to. Sometimes they can be organizing a flank in hivemind/radio, sometimes they can be walking up behind you with a slug-loaded shotgun. Either way, it pays to be alert to what they're doing, as much to as what the enemies are."
  - "You can always AdminHelp with the F1 key to question a member of staff regarding rules."
#  - "As ghost you are given extra tools for spectating the round. You can jump and follow specific players, get notifications about CAS and OB strikes, can see all health bars, and such."

  - "As a Military Police Officer, remember that correlation does not equal causation. Someone may have just been at the wrong place at the wrong time!"
  - "As a Doctor, try to be weary of overdosing your patients, especially if someone else has already been on the scene. Overdoses are often lethal to patients in crit!"

# Todo Tips. Tips that once the feature is added we should add back into the pool!

  #- You can insert empty pill bottles into ChemMasters before creating pills to have them automatically inserted.
  #- Nurses can practice a full range of surgeries on Professor DUMMY. Ask the gods to give you one if you see (or are) a nurse practicing.
  #- Vehicle Crewmen! it is often safer to repair the parts of your APC or tank inside the vehicle than outside it.
  #- It is almost always faster to do surgery manually than in the autodoc.
  #- Functioning night vision goggles can be recharged with batteries. Broken night vision goggles can be repaired by an Engineer with a screwdriver. Not the loadout ones though, those cannot be fixed.
  #- You can check the landing zone as a marine in the status panel.
  #- Be careful! Barricades block grenades, and indeed all thrown items, from the front if they're barbed up.
  #- CAS Fire Missions doubles the accuracy of fired weapons, which can be substantial.
  #- Painkillers do not stack. Only the strongest has any effect.
  #- Armor has a randomized reduction in effectiveness, and does not protect the digits. Take the wiki damage values as a best-case scenario.
  #- You can click on your Security Access Tuner (multitool) in your hand to locate the area's APC if there is one.
  #- Armor has insulative properties - taking it off will help you cool off and take less damage faster if you've been set on fire.
  #- When the M7 RPG is fired, it creates a substantial shockwave behind it that can stun and harm marines standing too close. Watch your backblast!
  #- You can link plasteel barricades together using a crowbar. First click one, and then click one adjacent. Repeat as needed.
  #- Reflective walls will bounce back non-IFF bullets, including rockets. Try not to shoot them.
  #- Never place barricades facing each other - Not only does this block bullets, both barricades are damaged at once if one is slashed!
  #- Examine your gun and click \\[See combat statistics\\] to view information such as damage for your weapon.
  #- When you have shrapnel embedded, take out your boot knife and use it in your hand to rip them out of your body.
 #- Items on the floor can be shot. Shoot a poorly thrown HEDP away to save your buddies!
 #- Xenonids can't apply parasites to marines if they're on fire.
  #- Dragging a Nanomed onto yourself instantly gives a Health Analyzer report. Always know what's wrong with you.
  #- Splints slow you down. Remove them after your bones are healed by using the Remove Your Splints verb.
  # Blood loss can lead to hunger, which can slow you down. Make sure you're always full after taking a beating.
  #- When fighting Xenonids, don't aim for the head - It won't increase damage against anyone but your fellow marines.
  #- Don't forget to set the Anti-Aircraft Gun!
  #- You can use a health analyzer in hand (Z key) to check the last scan readout from it.
  #- If a grenade comes your way, hit the deck! Lying down will reduce damage and let you dodge any shrapnel flying overhead.
