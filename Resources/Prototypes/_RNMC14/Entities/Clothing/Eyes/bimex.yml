  name: BiMex polarized shades
  description: Sleek, angular shades designed for the modern operator. BiMex's latest 'TactOptix' line comes with advanced polarization and lightweight ballistic lenses capable of shrugging off small shrapnel impacts. A favorite among frontline operators and deep-space scouts, these shades are marketed as 'combat-tested and action-approved.' Rumors abound of lucky users surviving close-range laser shots thanks to the multi-reflective lens coating, though BiMex's official stance is to 'Stop standing in front of lasers.'
