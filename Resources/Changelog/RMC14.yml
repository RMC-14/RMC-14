  - message: Added the missing job slot scaling feature that will adjust how many

      will for example allow up to 5 staff officers with 160 or more marines, with
      1 + 1 staff officer for each 40 marines, for a range of 2 to 5. The standard
      4 specs and sgs are available at 60 marines or above, with a minimum of 2 of
      each being available per round. This scaling won't affect research unlocking
      spec slots in the future once implemented.

      emotes in the dropship. Admins have better things to do than handle this dogshit
      rp every round. The scream hotbar action will always bypass this cooldown, also
      on a 20 second cooldown.
