  - message: The accuracy mechanic has been implemented. Projectiles can now miss
      creatures and pass through them without doing damage. Accuracy depends on the
      specific projectile and the firing weapon's multiplier. The latter can be seen
      by examining any given weapon. Accuracy decays rapidly past a certain distance.

      creatures between the shooter and the target. If the target is prone, it takes
      +20% damage from the PB. Note that you can't PB yourself on full-auto and will
      instead shoot normally.
