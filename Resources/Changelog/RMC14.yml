      to select an acting Commander. A Marine can remove his ID during the selection
      process if he does not want to be a Commander. After one minute, ARES selects
      candidates from available Marines and appoints an acting Commander with the
      highest authority and priority rank. The selected acting Commander will be announced  by
      ARES, including his name and title. Also, if necessary, additional access will
      be added to his ID. This system will help maintain the integrity of the operation
      with a low amount of players online.
