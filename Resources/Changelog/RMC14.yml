  - message: Added the tactical map. This can be used to get a view of the current
      planet map, and can be updated every 4 minutes by Command and the Queen to give
      each side drawn directions and a static view of everyone else's position at
      the time of the update. The tactical map can be opened with an action in your
      bar, and Command can edit it by opening a map table in CIC.

  - message: Removed the auto-balancing system that adjusts marines per xeno depending
      on round outcomes, as each individual update no longer has as big of an impact
      on balance as they used to and the biggest difference right now is made by the
      amount of players in the server.
    type: Remove
  - message: Added the missing job slot scaling feature that will adjust how many
      of each marine role are available depending on how many marines are playing.
      The scaling depends on the specific role, with the heaviest adjustments happening
      to still unimplemented roles (mess technician and ordnance technician), but
      will for example allow up to 5 staff officers with 160 or more marines, with
      1 + 1 staff officer for each 40 marines, for a range of 2 to 5. The standard
      4 specs and sgs are available at 60 marines or above, with a minimum of 2 of
      each being available per round. This scaling won't affect research unlocking
      spec slots in the future once implemented.

      creatures between the shooter and the target. If the target is prone, it takes
