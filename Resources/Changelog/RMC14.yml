  changes:
  - message: Added intel. Intel spawns at random spots on the planet. Paper scraps,
      progress reports, folders and technical manuals must be read and then stored
      in the Almayer's intel room for points. They can be found by using the data
      detector. Progress reports may require a paper scrap to be read first, and its
      data submitted in the intel computer inside the intel room; these clues are
      listed on the View Intel Objectives window available to all intel-trained personnel.
      Other sources of intels are dead xenos, which can be fultoned, perma-dead humanoid
      bodies, rescuing live survivors, restoring colony power, and restoring colony
      communications. Intel points can be exchanged for requisitions budget and additional
      OB warheads in CIC through the tech tree console.
