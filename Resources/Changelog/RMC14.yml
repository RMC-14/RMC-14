      through the lifeboats, or the escape pods. The escape pods may hold a maximum
      of 3 living beings, with any more than that causing them to crash. Escape pods
      may also crash if launched early, except for the one in the Liaison's office.
      The four fuel pump areas have sentries that may be deployed during a hijack.
      This change also temporarily removes the Savannah from selection until it can
      be updated to have all the evacuation and power mechanics.
