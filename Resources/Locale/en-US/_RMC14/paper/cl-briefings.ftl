    Discovered in 2097, the planet Dykuma I, also known as LV-686, was originally marked by geological survey as a potentially terraformable desert planet, was later found to be abundantly rich in underground aquifers of exceptionally high purity, and as such an independent core colony began colonization efforts in the 2100s.

    Shortly after the colonization efforts began, a hostile takeover by the Canadian Space Affairs Ministry in 2105 brought the colony under new ownership, soon sold to the Weston-Yamada Corporation, where in 2107 it began operations as a bottling plant under the [italic]Weston Spring[/italic] brand.

    As the demand for spring water and the size of the colony's operations both have grown, the deposits of drinking water at the original site for the colony have dried up, and as such the sprawl has continued to expand outwards, ever in search of more deposits to tap.

    With an estimated 2500 colonists, the refinery has become a bustling town, and the number one provider of drinkable water in the Zephyron Sector and surrounding space, as well as a significant supplier for the [italic]Weston Spring[/italic] brand.

    The number one priority is that any operation on the site of Weston Spring Bottling Center No. 8 does not employ chemical weapons or otherwise risk contaminating the groundwater supply and aquifers below. The use of lead and depleted uranium bullets should be avoided.

    Additionally, the colony’s water treatment plant contains large stockpiles of chemicals that may be hazardous in unapproved amounts. Damage to the tanks storing these chemicals must be mitigated.

    The Kutjevo facility contains only a token Colony Marshal Bureau, staffing roughly 2–6 members, and is primarily secured by corporate personnel. While the security garrison is relatively undersized for a colony of this size, division analysts believe corporate espionage is unlikely due to a variety of factors. After reviewing the data, analysts believe these are the most likely causes for the automated distress beacon, from most to least likely:

    • Geological activity (e.g. earthquakes or land-shift due to the drained aquifers beneath the site)
    • Maintenance failure of the colony's communications equipment
    • Failure to send the weekly "All-Clear" signal, resulting in an automated distress dispatch
    • Sabotage by the "Colonial Liberation Front"
    • A solar flare from the Dykuma star causing electrical failures

    Solaris Ridge initially started operations as an Independent Colony, which was attempting to terraform Routerra I utilizing lichens. Lichen-based terraforming is generally cheaper, but unproven and difficult. The two research labs on Solaris, Eta and Lambda, were established in order to test this technology.

    However, with subsequent growth batches failing to meet growth estimates, as well as technical failures and sandstorms would result in the maintenance costs being deemed untenable, resulting in the facility being sold to Weston-Yamada.

    When Weston-Yamada gained control of the Colony, both the Eta & Lambda labs were converted into a site for storage and research of biological materials. Furthermore, a mining facility was established to mine veins of Iron, Cobalt, and Copper. The colony currently holds ~120 Employees, including CMB Officers.

    Any operations on Routerra I should ensure that damage to critical infrastructure, such as filtration, mining, and medical, are minimized to damages deemed necessary for operational success.
    Weston-Yamada assets, including blackbox recordings, lichen & biological samples, as well as any personnel should be recovered by military personnel in the case of a critical loss of infrastructure or disaster.

    Despite its small population, Solaris Ridge has a somewhat substantial Colony Marshal Bureau presence near the northern Landing Zone. Due to the nature of the colony, Biological Safety procedures are in effect. Corporate Safety & Prevention Analysts indicate that these are the most likely causes of Communications Blackout, from most to least likely:

    • Large-scale sandstorms resulting in equipment failure or signal interference
    • Seismic instability resulting in damage to the colony
    • Hostile action undertaken by a Colonial Liberation Front cell
    • Biohazardous materials leakage, resulting in widespread contamination
