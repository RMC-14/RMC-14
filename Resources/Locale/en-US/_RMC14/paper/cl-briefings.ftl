    Discovered in 2097, the planet Dykuma I, also known as LV-686, was originally marked by geological survey as a potentially terraformable desert planet, was later found to be abundantly rich in underground aquifers of exceptionally high purity, and as such an independent core colony began colonization efforts in the 2100s.

    Shortly after the colonization efforts began, a hostile takeover by the Canadian Space Affairs Ministry in 2105 brought the colony under new ownership, soon sold to the Weston-Yamada Corporation, where in 2107 it began operations as a bottling plant under the [italic]Weston Spring[/italic] brand.

    As the demand for spring water and the size of the colony's operations both have grown, the deposits of drinking water at the original site for the colony have dried up, and as such the sprawl has continued to expand outwards, ever in search of more deposits to tap.

    With an estimated 2500 colonists, the refinery has become a bustling town, and the number one provider of drinkable water in the Zephyron Sector and surrounding space, as well as a significant supplier for the [italic]Weston Spring[/italic] brand.

    The number one priority is that any operation on the site of Weston Spring Bottling Center No. 8 does not employ chemical weapons or otherwise risk contaminating the groundwater supply and aquifers below. The use of lead and depleted uranium bullets should be avoided.

    Additionally, the colony’s water treatment plant contains large stockpiles of chemicals that may be hazardous in unapproved amounts. Damage to the tanks storing these chemicals must be mitigated.

    The Kutjevo facility contains only a token Colony Marshal Bureau, staffing roughly 2–6 members, and is primarily secured by corporate personnel. While the security garrison is relatively undersized for a colony of this size, division analysts believe corporate espionage is unlikely due to a variety of factors. After reviewing the data, analysts believe these are the most likely causes for the automated distress beacon, from most to least likely:

    • Geological activity (e.g. earthquakes or land-shift due to the drained aquifers beneath the site)
    • Maintenance failure of the colony's communications equipment
    • Failure to send the weekly "All-Clear" signal, resulting in an automated distress dispatch
    • Sabotage by the "Colonial Liberation Front"
    • A solar flare from the Dykuma star causing electrical failures

    Solaris Ridge initially started operations as an Independent Colony, which was attempting to terraform Routerra I utilizing lichens. Lichen-based terraforming is generally cheaper, but unproven and difficult. The two research labs on Solaris, Eta and Lambda, were established in order to test this technology.

    However, with subsequent growth batches failing to meet growth estimates, as well as technical failures and sandstorms would result in the maintenance costs being deemed untenable, resulting in the facility being sold to Weston-Yamada.

    When Weston-Yamada gained control of the Colony, both the Eta & Lambda labs were converted into a site for storage and research of biological materials. Furthermore, a mining facility was established to mine veins of Iron, Cobalt, and Copper. The colony currently holds ~120 Employees, including CMB Officers.

    Any operations on Routerra I should ensure that damage to critical infrastructure, such as filtration, mining, and medical, are minimized to damages deemed necessary for operational success.
    Weston-Yamada assets, including blackbox recordings, lichen & biological samples, as well as any personnel should be recovered by military personnel in the case of a critical loss of infrastructure or disaster.

    • Large-scale sandstorms resulting in equipment failure or signal interference
    • Seismic instability resulting in damage to the colony
    • Hostile action undertaken by a Colonial Liberation Front cell
    • Biohazardous materials leakage, resulting in widespread contamination

    Lazarus Landing was established by Weston-Yamada following the discovery of multiple xeno-archeological structures in the jungles and caves around the colony grounds.

    Currently, the exact origin of these structures are unknown, although current theories suggest the existence of an interstellar civilization before modern times. R&D's Archeological Department has a large presence on the colony.

    Furthermore, the United Nations "Whiskey Outpost" military base is also located on LV-624, although interactions between the base and the colony are practically non-existant.

    Fiorina Science Annex was initially founded by Weston-Yamada to take advantage of the rich platinum veins located on the planet of Fiorina 161. However the sustainability of this operation was overestimated; after less then a decade, extraction of platinum was deemed to be more expensive then could be recouped.

    In order to prevent serious loss of profit, Weston-Yamada partnered with the United Nations to establish Fiorina Science Annex, dedicated to the housing of High-Security inmates, as well as scientific research. Current estimates expect ~300 prisoners and ~120 employees to be on the station. Currently, the decommission of the station is being discussed by Weston-Yamada higher ups due to high operation costs for little gain.

    Onboard military personnel are to retrieve any notable research material from Research Cellblocks.
    Due to inconsistent and infrequent reports from the Command Staff of Fiorina, information should be gathered to ascertain the current operations of the Orbital Penitentiary.
    The potential decommission of the facility means that avoiding damage to the facility is less of a priority. The exception is the Engineering Ring, which could suffer a catastrophic failure and result in a large-scale nuclear explosion. Caution should be taken when engaging in high-damage actions around the ring.

    • Failure of several or more high-importance technical systems due to age and decommissioning risks
    • Spread of research-based hazard(s), which may include chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) hazards
    • Failure of the station's circadian rhythm retainment system, causing widespread insomnia and instability

    Hybrisa Prospera is one of the largest colonies in the Outer Veil and Zypheron Sector. Featuring a population in the tens of thousands, as well as multiple outposts and towns outside of the capital city, it has become a lynchpin in expanding into the Frontier.

    Previously owned by the Three-Sun Empire as a mining colony, Weston-Yamada has recently gained ownership. It's location has allowed it to become a nexus of interstellar trade and transit. It is estimated to become the most populated world in the outer rim.

    Recent reports indicate the presence of a large excavated vessel of unknown origins to the south of the colony, presumed to have crashed thousands of years ago. Little is known about it at this time, as local R&D representatives have kept their cards close to their chest.

    Shiva's Snowball was established by Weston-Yamada following a successful bid to purchase ownership of the planet. Initially established for the purposes of Climatological and Geological research, experts in archeological research would later be called in.

    The planet lies in the Altalune Drift, making it somewhat isolated. As such, the facility was designed for long-term independent habitation, including life-support systems, a botanical bay, on-site vehical repair garage, and state-of-the-art Aurora Medical Clinic.

    Shiva's Snowball also has a very small team of UN researchers, CMB Deputies and Peacekeepers stationed on-site, sent to aid joint UN-WEYA research into sub-zero climates.

    Damage to the facility should also be assessed during and after the operation to gauge habitability.

    If the colony is deemed no longer safe for current habitation, due to systems failures or an active threat, any Weston-Yamada or United Nations Researchers should be extracted, along with any other inhabitants of the colony.

    Recovery of important research notes, data, and assets is deemed important, and should be done by the shipside intelligence officers.

    Due to the isolated position of Ifrit, as well as the year-round snow and lack of consistent daylight, Corporate Safety & Prevention Analysts suspect that "Cabin Fever" may arise, potentially resulting in mental instability or restlessness in on-site personnel. The following are the most likely causes of distress signal, from most to least likely:

    • Deep-freeze resulting in critical damage to colonial infrastructure, including vital systems such as life-support.
    • High psychological strain on employees, resulting in extreme interpersonal tension and violence
    • Hostile action by employees aligned with the "Colony Liberation Front", due to dissatisfaction or distress arising from isolation and consistent darkness year-round
    • Medical emergency which cannot be handled by the Aurora Medical Clinic
    • False-alarm raised by distressed employees desperate for interactions with strangers

    Sorokyne Strata is an average-sized SPP colony in Zypheron, known primarily for its purpose of mining minerals such as carbon, lithium, and silicon, as well as geothermal research. SPP state-owned firm Sestra Solutions was delegated with constructing the colony.

    Little is known about Sorokyne Strata due to it's affiliation and ownership by the SPP. A small military presence is confirmed to be on-site.

    Prevent a dangerous diplomatic incident from occurring by avoiding antagonistic behavior towards SPP Colonists.
    Liaise with any potentially present Halcyon Executives to discuss potential joint-ventures.
    Investigate the cause of the incident as well as any SPP information of note, and report back to Weston-Yamada.

    Very little is known in regards to the societal stability of Sorokyne Strata. Corporate Safety & Prevention Analysts have revised the following causes of distress signal, from most to least likely:

    • Seismic incidents caused by highly-active geothermal activity, resulting in damage to the colony
    • Hostile action by an Anti-socialist "Colony Liberation Front" cell
    • Failure to send the weekly "all-clear" signal to prevent automated dispatch of a distress signal
    • Covert sabotage or hostile action by an unknown or classified UNMC or TSE military team
