Being the smart Executive the Company hired you to be, you decided to prepare your office for the worst when the first 'parasite' was born in the vats of the Research Dome. Turned out, you were right, everyone who called you crazy and called these the new 'synthetics' is now dead, you along with your Corporate Security detail are the only survivors due to your paranoia.

Once they came for the Dome and tried to kill all of you, you barely managed to hold them off even after losing one Officer and alot of the defences. The Liaison said they will soon find a way to contact Weston-Yamada and to remain steadfast until rescue arrives.
