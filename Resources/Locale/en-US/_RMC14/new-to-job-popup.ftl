rmc-new-to-job-popup-title = RMC14 New to Job Popup
rmc-new-to-job-popup-job-name = Welcome to {$name}!
rmc-new-to-job-additional = If you are ever confused on what to do, you can ask your seniors for help or press F1 > Mentor Help to get in contact with dedicated mentors who can help you.
rmc-new-to-job-popup-close-button = All ready!
rmc-new-to-job-popup-close-button-wait = The close button will be enabled after {$time} seconds.

rmc-new-to-job-req-tech = As a requisitions technician, your job is to dispense supplies to the UNMC marines through either working the main lines or helping the logistics officer with supply drops.

                                             You will find on the left of cargo, the main area you spawn at, two lines with 3 vendors between them. Marines will line up at those lines at the start of the round and ask for supplies. You can find most of them within those three vendors, with any other requests either found in the surplus uniform vendor south of you or by ordering them in the ARSR consoles near to your lines.

                                             After the initial rush of supplying marines, your job now becomes to assist the logistics officer with handling supply drops. They will task you with packing ammo, taking supplies from the squad prep rooms north or south of your department, or getting additional supplies from other departments – all in the name of getting marines armed.

rmc-new-to-job-nurse = As a nurse, your job is to assist doctors and learn the basics of medicine, so don't stress it if you're not constantly working. You can ask a doctor to show you the basics, and usually they will be more than happy to teach you how to treat patients.

                                             Your basic medical topical supplies are gauze / trauma kits / surgical lines for treating brute damage and ointment / burn kits / synth grafts for treating burn damage. Gauze and ointment are basic supplies anyone can use, with brute/burn kits healing damage fast and effectively when used by people with medical training – surgical lines and synth grafts are infinite use and can treat brute and burn effectively, so your go-to tools should be those. Taking brute damage can cause bleeding, reducing a person's blood level – so, ensure you treat their brute fast and early to prevent major blood loss.

                                             You can also use chemicals to treat people, healing them over time after an initial dosage. These can cover damage numbers that your typical topical supplies will only partially cover. Bicaradine, Meralyne, and their combination (MeraBic) treat Brute - Kelotane, Dermaline, and their combination (KeloDerma) treat burns. Kelotane and Bicaradine overdose at 30 - 50 units, while Meralyne and Dermaline overdose at 15 - 25 units. Ensure you do not give people too many units of chems, or they will suffer negative effects.

                                             You can use a Health Analyzer on a person to check their damage types, health and some suggestions for treatment. When a person is in critical state (Having taken 100+ damge), they will be lying on the floor unconscious, and after taking 200+ damage, they are dead. You can revive them with a defibrillator if their HP returns to over 0 through applying your topical supplies, and you can slow down their rotting (and reducing airloss damage when in crit) by performing CPR, clicking on them in 4 second intervals with nothing in-hand.

rmc-new-to-job-rifleman = As a rifleman, you are the main fighting force of your squad, having numbers to bolster. You have strength and less likelihood of being captured by the enemy force in numbers and proximity.

                                             As you wake up from cryo, you will be hungry. Get some food from the food vendors at the top or bottom of the room you woke up in. You can interact with left click and inspect with Shift + Left Click. Grab some food, and press E with the food in your hand to eat it.

                                             After you've eaten, walk left; you will see a large line of vendors – these are where you will get your clothing and other utility items, such as belts and pouches. Anything in orange is important, and green is mandatory. After getting your gear, continue left into the next room. You will find shared vendors for weapons, attachments, and surplus tools. The weapon racks are on the far left top and bottom of the shared room – grab a weapon and a magazine. You can load weapons by placing a magazine in your hand and clicking on the gun in your other hand. You can switch your main hand with X.

                                             Once you are supplied, head out into the hallway, and enter the room that is either south or north of you – it'll be a large room with lots of coloured chairs surrounding a podium. You will be briefed here if you joined at the start of the round – if you have missed the brief, do not worry; proceed to the next section.

                                             Now, head left, past medical (white walls) and into the hangar. A yellow dropship will land on the right landing pad, near to the white walls, eventually. Enter that dropship, buckle yourself to a seat by clicking on a chair, and eventually you will be taken groundside.

                                             On the right of your screen, you will see a grey and black rectangle with a coloured arrow, with 'SL' underneath – this is a pointer for your squad leader. Follow it to find your squad. You can speak to your squad by pressing T and then putting a ';h' at the start of your message. This will only work if the communications relay tower is fixed and powered, which you don't need to worry about, but it will mean that sometimes this won't work. You can speak to those around you by simply pressing T and typing.

                                             You can do a left curly bracket at the start of your message to type in 'LOOC', which will let you talk about things outside of your character, which is helpful for telling people you are new or need help.

rmc-new-to-job-staff-officer = As a staff officer, your job is to “overwatch”, monitor and support the squad under your tasking, and relay orders from the operation Commander.

                                             Your main posting is in CIC, at one of four terminals marked by coloured metal plating corresponding to one of four squads. The terminal can send a squad message (send a blue, visible message to the squad regardless of comms), swap marines to another squad, assign someone as acting squad leader, and directly watch marines via helmet cameras (clicking on their name, which only works with a helmet or camera gear). You also have access to a live tactical map, which updates live with marine positions and statuses (alongside xenos, if sensors are up), and a telephone, which allows you to call any other telephone and communicate via speaking without the use of radio.

                                             You can also send supply drops via the Supply Drops tab on the left. Communicate with Requisitions to ensure your supply drop has the supplies that are necessary and that the crate is ready over the requisitions radio frequency (u;). Once the crate is sealed, the crate can be sent on coordinates under roof level 0 or 1.

                                             Normally, your presence at the briefing is necessary, but if you feel you might need more help or time, you can ask to be excused in order to experiment and test squad consoles.

rmc-new-to-job-military-police = As an MP, your job is to enforce Marine Law (MLAW) and the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the Marines, along with acting as the first line of defence for the ship. The details of which can be found in the guidebook or in books vended from your gearing vendor, located to the left of the hypersleep room. The goal of MPs is to make the server a more immersive and enjoyable place for everyone. Do your best to uphold that goal, by mediating conflicts and assisting the crew and marines with their needs, using the minimal force required.

                                             After getting a feel for MLAW and SOP at the start of an operation, MPs are typically posted at requisitions, lower medical, and briefing hall – anywhere you would find a large concentration of Marines – to better keep order. If you notice behaviour that stands out to you as unusual, it's a good idea to review the books again or ask your peers on the MP radio about the situation. The information you gain can help guide your actions. Usually, however, your mere presence will be enough to deter most issues. Keep an eye on the radio for signs of problems forming and respond accordingly to maintain tensions and prevent troublemakers from disrupting the ship's operations.

                                             If you, or another officer, make an arrest. The suspect will be brought to the brig for sentencing by the military warden or chief of military police (CMP) in the holding cell, located just southwest of the main entrance; this is also where the regular cells are. From here, you have permanent confinement – and the execution room to your west, and the armoury for red alert ship conditions is to your north. Only the Warden and CMP can open this armoury in standard ship codes, so ask them if you need access to store something.

                                             After the Marines deploy, your time will be spent patrolling the ship, assisting with logistical tasks, moving boxes of intelligence to the computer lab on the second floor, and helping with mortuary duties. You can also advise and teach new players through drills or just general support, and you have ample spare time to head to FOB or walk around the ship to RP and hang out.

                                             If survivors are recovered from the ground, it's your job to help process them and ensure they receive medical treatment and examination. Check your guidebook for details on third-party processing when you hear survivors are on the way up. You will also be expected to process and control prisoners of war, which can be found in the third-party section of the guidebook.

rmc-new-to-job-dcc = As a Dropship Crew Chief, your job is to assist the pilots and ensure the smooth operation of the dropships.

                                             At the beginning of the round, decide which pilot you would like to assist and ask them what they would like installed on their ship. North of the dropships there is a room with a part fabricator and power loaders. Be sure to use the premade parts lying around the hangar before fabricating any additional ones.

                                             Get in one of the loaders to pick up and install parts onto the appropriate hardpoints of the ships, and use the fabricator to print additional parts and ammunition. Every pilot has different preferences, so be sure to ask before you print anything! You may be asked to procure other items for the ships from medical or requisitions as well.

                                             Once the ships are prepped and the mission is underway, you will ride with the pilot and assist them with various tasks:

                                             On The Dropship Alamo (Yellow) you will be expected to help load and unload various items. Intel documents and corpses are to be brought up and left in the hangar bay near the doors to medical.

                                             On The Dropship Normandy (Grey) you will be expected to reload the weapons between flights. Use the power loader to remove partially spent payloads from the weapons, combine boxes of ammunition, and insert it back into the guns. Completely empty weapons simply need fresh ammo inserted.

                                             In the case of a medevac, go to the back of the ship and interact with the red medevac module. This will bring the patient up onto your ship from the ground. Inform the Almayer's medical staff that they are coming aboard and make sure they are brought into their care.

                                             You may be required to perform additional tasks, such as retrieving medical supplies, obtaining parachutes, triage of revivable marine personnel, and any other task given by your assigned pilot.
