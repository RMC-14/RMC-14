rmc-new-to-job-req-tech = As a Requisitions Technician, your job is to dispense supplies to the UNMC marines through either working the main lines, or helping the Logistics Officer with Supply Drops.

                                             You will find on the left of cargo, the main area you spawn at, two lines with 3 vendors between them. Marines will line up at those lines at the start of the round and ask for supplies. You can find most of them within those three vendors, with any other requests either found in the surplus uniform vendor south of you , or by ordering them in the ARSR consoles near to your lines.

                                             After the initial rush of supplying marines, your job now becomes to assist the Logistics Officer with handling supply drops. They will task you with packing ammo, taking supplies from the squad prep rooms north or south of your department, or getting additional supplies from other departments - All in the name of getting marines armed.

rmc-new-to-job-nurse = As a Nurse, your job is assist doctors and learn the basics of medical, so don't stress it if you're not constantly working. You can ask a doctor to show you the basics, and usually they will be more than happy to teach you how to treat patients.

                                             Your basic medical topical supplies are Gauze / Trauma Kits / Surgical Lines for treating Brute damage, and Ointment / Burn Kits / Synth Graft for treating Burn damage. Gauze and Ointment are basic supplies anyone can use, with Brute / Burn kits healing damage fast and effectively when used by people with medical training - Surgical Lines and Synth Grafts are infinite use and can treat brute and burn effectively, so your go to tools should be those. Taking Brute damage can cause bleeding, reducing a person's blood level - So, ensure you treat their brute fast and early to prevent major blood loss.

                                             You can also use chemicals to treat people, healing them over time after an initial dosage. These can cover damage numbers that your typical topical supplies will only partially cover. Bicaradine, Meralyne, and their combination (MeraBic) treats Brute - Kelotane, Dermaline, and their combination (KeloDerma) treat burns. Kelotane and Bicaradine overdose at 30 - 50 units, While Meralyne and Dermaline overdose at 15 - 25 units. Ensure you do not give people too many units of chems, or they will suffer negative effects.

                                             You can use a Health Analyzer on a person to check their damage types, health and some suggestions for treatment. When a person is below 100 health out of 200, they will enter 'crit', lying on the floor unconcious, and at 0 or below, they are dead. You can revive them with a defibrilator if their HP returns to over 0 through applying your topical supplies, and you can slow down their rotting (and reducing airloss damage when in crit) by performing CPR, clicking on them in 4 second intervals with nothing inhand.

rmc-new-to-job-rifleman = As a rifleman, you are the main fighting force of your squad, having numbers to bolster. You have strength, and less likelyhood to be captured by the enemy force, in numbers and proximity.

                                             As you wake up from cryo, you will be hungry. Get some food from the food vendors at the north or south of the room you woke up in. You can interact with left click, and inspect with Shift + Left Click. Grab some food, and press E with the food in your hand to eat it.

                                             After you've eaten, walk left, you will see a large line of vendors - These are where you will get your clothing and other utility items, such as belts and pouches. Anything in orange is important, and green is mandatory. After getting your gear, continue left into the next room. You will find shared vendors for weapons, attachments, and surplus tools. The weapon racks are on the far left top and bottom of the shared room - Grab a weapon, and a magazine. You can load weapons by placing a magazine in your hand, and clicking on the gun in your other hand. You can switch your main hand with X.

                                             Once you are supplied, head out into the hallway, and enter the room that is either south, or north of you - It'll be a large room with lots of coloured chairs surrounding a podium. You will be briefed here if you joined at the start of the round - If you have missed the brief, do not worry, proceed to the next section.

                                             Now, head left, past medical (White walls) and into the hangar. A yellow dropship will land on the right landing pad, near to the white walls, eventually. Enter that dropship, buckle yourself to a seat by clicking on a chair, and eventually you will be taken groundside.

                                             On the right of your screen, you will see a grey and black rectangle with a coloured arrow, with 'SL' underneath - This is a pointer for your Squad leader. Follow it to find your squad. You can speak to your squad by pressing T, and then putting a ';h' at the start of your message. This will only work if communications relay tower is fixed and powered, which you dont need to worry about, but it will mean that sometimes this wont work. You can speak to those around you by simply pressing T and typing.

                                             You can do a left cirly bracket at the start of your message to type in 'LOOC', which will let you talk about things outside of your character, which is helpful for telling people you are new or need help.
