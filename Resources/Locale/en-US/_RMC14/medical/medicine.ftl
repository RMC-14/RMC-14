reagent-name-cmarithrazine = Arithrazine
reagent-desc-cmarithrazine = A stabilized variant of dylovene. Its toxin-cleansing properties are weakened and there are harmful side effects, but it does not react with other compounds to create toxin.

reagent-name-cmbicaridine = Bicaridine
reagent-desc-cmbicaridine = Bicaridine is an analgesic medication and can be used to treat severe external blunt trauma and to stabilize patients. Overdosing on Bicaridine will cause caustic burns and toxins.

reagent-name-cmcryoxadone = Cryoxadone
reagent-desc-cmcryoxadone = Industrial grade cryogenic medicine. Treats most types of tissue damage. Its main limitation is that the patient's body temperature must be under 170K to metabolise correctly.

reagent-name-cmdermaline = Dermaline
reagent-desc-cmdermaline = Advanced medicine used to treat severe burn trauma. Enables the body to restore even the direst heat-damaged tissue. Overdosing on dermaline can cause severe internal tissue damage.

reagent-name-cmdexalin = Dexalin
reagent-desc-cmdexalin = Dexalin is used in the treatment of oxygen deprivation by feeding oxygen to red blood cells directly inside the bloodstream. Used as an antidote to lexorin poisoning.

reagent-name-cmdexalinplus = Dexalin Plus
reagent-desc-cmdexalinplus = Dexalin Plus is an upgraded form of Dexalin with added iron and carbon to quicken the rate which oxygen binds to the hemoglobin in red blood cells.

reagent-name-cmepinephrine = Epinephrine
reagent-desc-cmepinephrine = A natural muscle and heart stimulant. Useful for restarting the heart. Overdosing may stress the heart and cause tissue damage.

reagent-name-cminaprovaline = Inaprovaline
reagent-desc-cminaprovaline = Inaprovaline is a synaptic stimulant and cardiostimulant. Commonly used to stabilize patients. If the lungs are functional, inaprovaline will allow respiration while under cardiac arrest. Acts as a weak painkiller. Overdosing may cause severe damage to cardiac tissue.

reagent-name-cmkelotane = Kelotane
reagent-desc-cmkelotane = Common medicine used to treat burns, caustic and corrosive trauma. Overdosing on kelotane can cause internal tissue damage.

reagent-name-cmleporazine = Leporazine
reagent-desc-cmleporazine = A drug used to treat hypothermia and hyperthermia. Stabilizes patient body temperture. Prevents the use of cryogenics. Overdosing on leporazine can cause extreme drowsyness.

reagent-name-cmtricordrazine = Tricordrazine
reagent-desc-cmtricordrazine = Tricordrazine is a highly potent stimulant, originally derived from cordrazine. Can be used to treat a wide range of injuries.

reagent-name-cmmeralyne = Meralyne
reagent-desc-cmmeralyne = Advanced analgesic medication used to treat extremely severe blunt trauma. Allows the body to quickly repair damaged tissue. Overdosing on Meralyne can cause severe corrosion to cell membranes.

reagent-name-cmimidazoline = Imidazoline
reagent-desc-cmimidazoline = Used for treating non-genetic eye trauma. Generally prescribed as treatment for most cases of eye trauma instead of performing a surgical operation.

reagent-name-cmclonexadone = Clonexadone
reagent-desc-cmclonexadone = Advanced cryogenic medicine made from cryoxadone. Treats most types of tissue damage. Requires temperatures below 170K to to metabolise correctly.

reagent-name-rmcrussianred = Russian Red
reagent-desc-rmcrussianred = An emergency radiation treatment. The list of potential side effects include retinal damage and unconsciousness.

# Antidepressants
reagent-name-rmcmethylphenidate = Methylphenidate
reagent-desc-rmcmethylphenidate = A commonly prescribed psychostimulant that increases activity of the central nervous system. Often used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. This drug improves performance primarily in the executive function in the prefrontal cortex (reasoning, inhibiting behaviors, organizing, problem solving, planning ect.)

reagent-name-rmccitalopram = Citalopram
