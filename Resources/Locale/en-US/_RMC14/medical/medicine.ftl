reagent-name-cmdylovene = Dylovene
reagent-desc-cmdylovene = General use anti-toxin, that neutralizes most toxins in the bloodstream. Commonly used in many advanced chemicals. Can be used as a mild anti-hallucinogen and to reduce tiredness.

reagent-name-cmethylredoxrazine = Ethylredoxrazine
reagent-desc-cmethylredoxrazine = Neutralizes the effects of alcohol in the blood stream, by oxidizing it into water molecules. However, it does not stop immediate intoxication. Ethylredoxrazine being a powerful oxidizer, it becomes toxic in high doses.

reagent-name-cmarithrazine = Arithrazine
reagent-desc-cmarithrazine = A stabilized variant of dylovene. Its toxin-cleansing properties are weakened and there are harmful side effects, but it does not react with other compounds to create toxin.

reagent-name-cmbicaridine = Bicaridine
reagent-desc-cmbicaridine = Bicaridine is an analgesic medication and can be used to treat severe external blunt trauma and to stabilize patients. Overdosing on Bicaridine will cause caustic burns and toxins.

reagent-name-cmcryoxadone = Cryoxadone
reagent-desc-cmcryoxadone = Industrial grade cryogenic medicine. Treats most types of tissue damage. Its main limitation is that the patient's body temperature must be under 170K to metabolise correctly.

reagent-name-cmdermaline = Dermaline
reagent-desc-cmdermaline = Advanced medicine used to treat severe burn trauma. Enables the body to restore even the direst heat-damaged tissue. Overdosing on dermaline can cause severe internal tissue damage.

reagent-name-cmdexalin = Dexalin
reagent-desc-cmdexalin = Dexalin is used in the treatment of oxygen deprivation by feeding oxygen to red blood cells directly inside the bloodstream. Used as an antidote to lexorin poisoning.

reagent-name-cmdexalinplus = Dexalin Plus
reagent-desc-cmdexalinplus = Dexalin Plus is an upgraded form of Dexalin with added iron and carbon to quicken the rate which oxygen binds to the hemoglobin in red blood cells.

reagent-name-cmepinephrine = Epinephrine
reagent-desc-cmepinephrine = A natural muscle and heart stimulant. Useful for restarting the heart. Overdosing may stress the heart and cause tissue damage.

reagent-name-cminaprovaline = Inaprovaline
reagent-desc-cminaprovaline = Inaprovaline is a synaptic stimulant and cardiostimulant. Commonly used to stabilize patients. If the lungs are functional, inaprovaline will allow respiration while under cardiac arrest. Acts as a weak painkiller. Overdosing may cause severe damage to cardiac tissue.

reagent-name-cmkelotane = Kelotane
reagent-desc-cmkelotane = Common medicine used to treat burns, caustic and corrosive trauma. Overdosing on kelotane can cause internal tissue damage.

reagent-name-cmleporazine = Leporazine
reagent-desc-cmleporazine = A drug used to treat hypothermia and hyperthermia. Stabilizes patient body temperture. Prevents the use of cryogenics. Overdosing on leporazine can cause extreme drowsyness.

reagent-name-cmtricordrazine = Tricordrazine
reagent-desc-cmtricordrazine = Tricordrazine is a highly potent stimulant, originally derived from cordrazine. Can be used to treat a wide range of injuries.

reagent-name-cmmeralyne = Meralyne
reagent-desc-cmmeralyne = Advanced analgesic medication used to treat extremely severe blunt trauma. Allows the body to quickly repair damaged tissue. Overdosing on Meralyne can cause severe corrosion to cell membranes.

reagent-name-cmimidazoline = Imidazoline
reagent-desc-cmimidazoline = Used for treating non-genetic eye trauma. Generally prescribed as treatment for most cases of eye trauma instead of performing a surgical operation.

reagent-name-cmclonexadone = Clonexadone
reagent-desc-cmclonexadone = Advanced cryogenic medicine made from cryoxadone. Treats most types of tissue damage. Requires temperatures below 170K to to metabolise correctly.
