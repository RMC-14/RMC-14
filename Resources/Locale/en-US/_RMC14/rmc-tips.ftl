rmc-tips-24 = Armor piercing ammunition does less damage to unarmored targets.
rmc-tips-25 = You can find breaching charges in Requisitions or the Squad Engineer vendor. They function like C4, but can be deployed and explode much quicker, and release powerful shrapnel on the opposite side. They require minor engineering knowledge, which can be obtained from pamphlets.
