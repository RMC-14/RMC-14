reagent-name-rmcphoron = Phoron
reagent-desc-rmcphoron = A special form of metallic plasma that is not found on Earth. While phoron is highly flammable and extremely toxic, its high energy density makes it one of the best solid fuel alternatives. Liquid phoron is often used for research purposes and in the medical industry a catalyst to many advanced chemicals.

reagent-name-rmcnapalm-ut = UT-Napthal Fuel
reagent-desc-rmcnapalm-ut = Known as Ultra Thick Napthal Fuel, a sticky combustible liquid chemical, typically used with flamethrowers.

reagent-name-rmcbgel = Napalm B-Gel
reagent-desc-rmcbgel = Unlike its liquid contemporaries, this gelled variant of napalm is easily extinguished, but shoots far and lingers on the ground in a viscous mess, while reacting with inorganic materials to ignite them.

reagent-name-rmcnapalm-b = Napalm B
reagent-desc-rmcnapalm-b = A special variant of napalm that's unable to cling well to anything, but disperses over a wide area while burning slowly. The composition reacts with inorganic materials to ignite them, causing severe damage.

reagent-name-rmcrapalm-x = Napalm X
reagent-desc-rmcrapalm-x = A sticky combustible liquid chemical that burns extremely hot.

reagent-name-rmcnapalm = Napalm
reagent-desc-rmcnapalm = This will probably ignite before you get to read this.

reagent-name-rmcnapalm-sticky = Sticky-Napalm
reagent-desc-rmcnapalm-sticky = A custom napalm mix, stickier and lasts longer but lower damage.

reagent-name-rmcnapalm-hc = High-Combustion Napalm Fuel
reagent-desc-rmcnapalm-hc = A custom napalm mix, higher damage but not as sticky.

reagent-name-rmcclf3 = Chlorine Trifluoride
reagent-desc-rmcclf3 = A highly reactive interhalogen compound capaple of self ignition. A very strong oxidizer and is extremely reactive with most organic and inorganic materials.

reagent-name-rmcnapalm-e = Napalm E
reagent-desc-rmcnapalm-e = A sticky combustible liquid chemical that penetrates the best fire retardants.

reagent-name-rmcnapalm-ex = Napalm EX
reagent-desc-rmcnapalm-ex = A sticky combustible liquid chemical made up of a combonation of rare and dangerous reagents both that penetrates the best fire retardants, and burns extremely hot.

reagent-name-rmcr189 = R189
reagent-desc-rmcr189 = A SPP chemical, it burns at an extremely high tempature and is designed to melt directly through fortified positions or bunkers.

reagent-name-rmcmethane = Methane
reagent-desc-rmcmethane = An easily combustible hydrocarbon that can very rapidly expand a fire, even explosively at the right concentrations. It is used primarily as fuel to make heat and light or manufacturing of organic chemicals.
