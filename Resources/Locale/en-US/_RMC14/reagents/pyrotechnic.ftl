reagent-name-rmcphoron = Phoron
reagent-desc-rmcphoron = A special form of metallic plasma that is not found on Earth. While phoron is highly flammable and extremely toxic, its high energy density makes it one of the best solid fuel alternatives. Liquid phoron is often used for research purposes and in the medical industry a catalyst to many advanced chemicals.

reagent-name-rmcnapalmut = UT-Napthal Fuel
reagent-desc-rmcnapalmut = Known as Ultra Thick Napthal Fuel, a sticky combustible liquid chemical, typically used with flamethrowers.

reagent-name-rmcbgel = Napalm B-Gel
reagent-desc-rmcbgel = Unlike its liquid contemporaries, this gelled variant of napalm is easily extinguished, but shoots far and lingers on the ground in a viscous mess, while reacting with inorganic materials to ignite them.

reagent-name-rmcnapalb = Napalm B
reagent-desc-rmcnapalb = A special variant of napalm that's unable to cling well to anything, but disperses over a wide area while burning slowly. The composition reacts with inorganic materials to ignite them, causing severe damage.

reagent-name-rmcrapalmx = Napalm X
reagent-desc-rmcrapalmx = A sticky combustible liquid chemical that burns extremely hot.
