  # Core Rule 14 - Do not use LOOC or OOC to share current round information
  Local Out of Character (LOOC) and Out of Character (OOC) channel are meant for things that don't relate to the current round. Using these channels to share round info is often referred to as "IC in OOC" or "ick ock".

  ## MRP Amendment
  Except in circumstances where it would be otherwise required to explain mechanics of the game, this rule is also extended to using LOOC to communicate with other players. Players should be using in-game in-character forms of communication, even when teaching new players.

  ## Examples
  Things you should [color=#a4885c]not[/color] do:
  - Use LOOC to tell someone you are an antagonist.
  - Use LOOC to tell someone that your character is not lying.

  Things you could do instead:
  - Use codewords in-character.
  - Try to convince them that you are not lying in-character, or accept that you won't be able to convince them.
