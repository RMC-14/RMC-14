  #Your first day as a rifleman!

  - Just woke up from cryosleep? Well you're probably hungry, so you should head to the food vendor and get something to eat.
  - Make sure to also take a canteen with you so you have water.

  - Next head to the standard equipment rack to get your armor and storage!

  - And finally, visit the automated weapons rack to pick a weapon and mags to go with it!
  We recommend the M41A Pulse Rifle for beginners.
  - Also make sure to grab a few armor piercing (AP) mags for the heavier xenos! They'll be impossible to kill otherwise.

  - Now you're ready to kill xenomorphs! Try to find the meeting room with your squadmates if the operation hasn't started yet.
  - Otherwise, ask around for help finding the dropship and get in there!

  - If you need any help, try to find your local mentor, the SEA. You can also ahelp by pressing F1.
