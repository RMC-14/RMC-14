  ##Where to place?
  You can hide resin holes by planting them under debris such as planks and certain chairs, use this to your advantage to get the sneak up on any host and capture them, it is recommended to place these on the backline as they are easily destroyed by explosions which are common on the front.

  Tip is to break wooden chairs and barricades to make planks so that you can hide your traps!

  They also give off a alert when destroyed, this can be used to gather intel or to block off flank routes that hosts might use!
