  ## Elite Assets of the UNMC
  Squad Specialists are among the most powerful assets the UNMC deploys. From the outset, these operatives can dramatically influence the outcome of any battle.

  While they have access to unique kits and potent squad-supporting weaponry, they are [bold]not[/bold] lone wolves or "rambos" and should operate as integral parts of the team.
  Understanding each specialist's role is crucial to maximizing their impact on the marine war machine.

  This page provides a general tips for new specialists, followed by brief introductions to each specific kit, leading to more detailed individual guides.

  ## General Tips for All Specialists

   <Box>[bold]Ammunition is Precious[/bold]: </Box>
  - Most specialist ammunition is potent and expensive (in terms of requisition points or rarity). [color=#ffcc00]Conserve it.[/color]
  - For many kits, consider requesting extra ammo from Requisitions early in the round to avoid running dry at critical moments.

   <Box>[bold]Know Your Gear & Role[/bold]: </Box>
  - Understand the strengths, weaknesses, and optimal use cases for your specific specialist kit and its weaponry. Don't use an anti-armor rocket on lone drones if your team needs them for a Crusher.
  - Before deploying, be intimately familiar with every piece of equipment in your kit. Know how to switch ammo types quickly, the effective range of your weapons, and the blast radius or unique properties of your ordnance/abilities.

   <Box>[bold]Situational Awareness is Key[/bold]: </Box>
  - As a high-value target, you are prone to being [italic]targeted[/italic] by hostiles. Maintain constant vigilance, especially for flanks.
  - Wearing standard marine armor instead of your specialist armor can sometimes reduce this, but at the cost of your specialized armor's benefits.

   <Box>[bold]Stay Alive, You're a Force Multiplier[/bold]: </Box>
  - While every marine's life is valuable, as a specialist, you bring unique capabilities that can turn the tide. Play smart, don't take unnecessary risks, and prioritize your survival to continue supporting your team. Your loss is often a greater blow to the squad's overall capability.
