  ## What do Military Police do?


  Military police are the role that is entrusted in-game to enforce [textlink="Mlaw (Marine law)" link="RMCMarineLaw"] and [textlink="SOP (Standard Operating Procedure)" link="RMCMarineSOP"]. This is typically done with the intent of enforcing server rules and roleplay standards in a way that can be immersive in character. [bold]The goal of being a MP is not to brig as many marines as you can.[/bold] That is frowned upon. The goal of [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color]s is to make the server a more immersive and enjoyable place for everyone. Do your best to uphold that goal.
