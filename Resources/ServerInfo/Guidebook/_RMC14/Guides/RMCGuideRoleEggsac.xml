  #Eggsac, Tier 2
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="RMCXenoCarrierEggsac"/>
  ##Playing as a Eggsac
  You have given up your ability to store parasites. You can store 12 eggs, produce eggs with your eggsac, place 4 eggs off hive weeds that decay slower if you are near, and your pheromones have been strengthened.

  Eggsac Carriers are specialised for egg production and can keep the hive supplied when queen isn't making eggs

  Your planted eggs are also unique as they can now be placed on regular weeds, however, they will decay if you move away from them. You can use these to make egg traps that hosts may walk into or help Oppressors by placing eggs near where they are going to hook.
