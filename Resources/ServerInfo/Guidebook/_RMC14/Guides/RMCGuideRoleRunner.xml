  #Runner, Tier 1

  ##Playing as a Runner
  You are the fastest and weakest. Use your speed to transport hosts from the frontline and scout the backlines, you can run over window frames and under tables. Use your pounce to slash or begin tackling hosts, however beware of shotguns as they will kill you instantly at close range.

  If you are new, the easiest way to contribute is focusing on dragging captures from the frontline to backline, remember that if they stab you from the inside you can regurgitate and tackle them down again to devour.
