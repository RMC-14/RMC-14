  ##Playing as a Warrior
  Being very different from Defender, you now act as a primary attacker by staying on the frontline. Singling hosts out, use your Lunge to grab hosts and Fling them towards the hive. After this, you can tackle them to capture.

  Beware that you have a smaller armor pool than Defender and will be easy to kill if dragging a target after lunging.

  Using your environment is the key to kill hosts in groups, you can fling and punch them into walls to deal even more damage. If you want to fight a duo, then lunge one and fling the other. This lets you weaken them down slowly.

  Reminder that the stun from lunge is as long as you keep a hold of them, if you let go of your drag it will cancel their stun prematurely. In other cases this stun is long enough to tackle them down after a lunge.
