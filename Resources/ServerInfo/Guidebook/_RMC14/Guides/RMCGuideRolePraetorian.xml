  ##Playing as a Praetorian

  Base Praetorian is similar to an upgraded Spitter, specializing in consistent ranged attacks and having a dash ability. They can sync up multiple abilities to deal bursts of damage from around corners such as Acid Spit and Acid Ball.

  Its passive grants acid-based attacks a stack of acid to targets. Once they reach 5 stacks they will take additional burn damage and sizzle. These stacks can be easily reached by stacking multiple abilities on the same target.
