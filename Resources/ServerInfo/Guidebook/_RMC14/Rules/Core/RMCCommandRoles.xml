  ## Command Roles, Disconnecting
  Don't quit a command level role without notifying your supervisor and an admin.
  - If you do not want to play a role, do not opt-in for it. Higher ranking roles are always selected first, regardless of role preferences, if nobody else selects them.
  - Command roles help drive rounds. If you need to leave, use cryo and please admin-help your role and that you are leaving.
  - There is no need to wait for a reply when admin-helping that you need to disconnect as a head role.
