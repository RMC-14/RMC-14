  # Don't use multiple SS14 accounts to play.

  - Players knowingly using multiple SS14 accounts will have all of their accounts banned. Appeal with the account you intend to use.
  - This is to prevent players from exploiting game systems and will be treated as such.
  - Players should avoid sharing accounts. Any actions taken on a shared account will be noted for the use of the account, and not per player using it.
