  ## Don't antagonize others.
  You are playing a multiplayer game with other people who also want to enjoy the game.
  - Do not intentionally make other players' lives hell for your own amusement.
  - Intentionally making yourself a major problem/annoyance/disruption for other players while not a hostile force is forbidden.
  - Give disconnected players at least 5-10 minutes (or until their character falls asleep) to return before considering taking their equipment or sending them to hypersleep. Returning to all your equipment being stolen or being removed from the round by your own team is not a good experience.
  - For the same reason, do not take equipment from revivable dead players.
  - Avoid berating new players. They cannot be expected to have full knowledge of the game, and should be taught rather than insulted.
  - The goal of [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color] is to make the server a more immersive and enjoyable place for everyone. Do your best to uphold that goal, by mediating conflicts and assisting the crew and marines with their needs with the minimal force required.
  - If your behavior in the Military Police role does not meet community standards, you may be subject to a roleban. This may not be an indication of a bad player, but it is an indication that a player doesn't have the understanding required to play MP.

  ## Crimes in Character

  Crimes must have sufficient in character motivation behind them, obtained during the round.

  - There is leeway for minor crimes that benefit your character with a provided roleplay reason, which have consequences for your character if caught.
  - If you are caught, stay in character. Do not complain in any OOC channel, as it is not the fault of other players for playing their role - you are responsible for the actions you took.
  - Disconnecting / making a mess of the brig when being caught can be used as evidence in lack of roleplaying behavior when doing crimes.
  - Do not consistently commit crimes across rounds (admin discretion), as this is very annoying to other players, a cause of ooc grudges, and almost never in character.
  - Players should not be charged more than once every 3 real days under normal gameplay, considering the server often exceeds 200 players with many of them being marines each round.

  ### Examples of invalid reasons for crimes:

  - "The MPs have nothing to do."
  - "I'm giving the MPs things to do."
  - Being bored.
  - Planning to commit a crime out of character before even joining the round.

  [bold]Other players have their own work and/or roleplay to do, or want to do, independent of everyone else at any given moment and do not need additional things to take care of, especially not from their own team. [/bold]

  ## Don't target players across rounds.
  Don't harass or target players across rounds for actions in prior rounds outside the game or in OOC.
  - Annoying players for in character reasons, as a character in the current round is fine; doing it across rounds or as a ghost role after they have interacted with you is not.
  - Do not annoy or target players out of character for actions they took in any round.
  - Do not threaten or imply to players that you are calling the admins on them.
  - Do not harass military police players between rounds or out of game for playing their role.
