  ## Don't antagonize your team.
  You are playing a multiplayer game with other people who also want to enjoy the game.
  - Do not intentionally make other players' lives hell for your own amusement.
  - Intentionally making yourself a major problem/annoyance/disruption for other players at large while not a hostile force is forbidden.
  - There is leeway for minor crimes that benefit your character, which has consequences for your character if caught.

  ## Don't target players across rounds.
  Don't harass or target players across rounds for actions in prior rounds outside of the game.
  - Annoying players for in character reasons in the current round is fine; doing it across rounds or as a ghost role after they have interacted with you is not.
  - Do not annoy or target players out of character for actions they took in any round.
  - Do not threaten or imply to players that you are calling the admins on them.
  - Do not harass military police players between rounds or out of game for playing their role.
