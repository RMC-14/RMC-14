  ## Don't antagonize others.
  You are playing a multiplayer game with other people who also want to enjoy the game.
  - Do not intentionally make other players' lives hell for your own amusement.
  - Intentionally making yourself a major problem/annoyance/disruption for other players while not a hostile force is forbidden.
  - There is leeway for minor crimes that benefit your character, which has consequences for your character if caught.
  - Give disconnected players at least 5-10 minutes to return before considering taking their equipment or sending them to cryosleep. Returning to all your equipment being stolen or being removed from the round by your own team is not a good experience.
  - For the same reason, do not take equipment from revivable dead players.
  - Avoid berating new players. They cannot be expected to have full knowledge of the game, and should be taught rather than insulted.

  ## Don't target players across rounds.
  Don't harass or target players across rounds for actions in prior rounds outside the game.
  - Annoying players for in character reasons in the current round is fine; doing it across rounds or as a ghost role after they have interacted with you is not.
  - Do not annoy or target players out of character for actions they took in any round.
  - Do not threaten or imply to players that you are calling the admins on them.
  - Do not harass military police players between rounds or out of game for playing their role.
