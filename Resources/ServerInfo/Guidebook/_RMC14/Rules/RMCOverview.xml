  # RMC-14 Rules

  [color=#ff0000][bold]If you are unable to click any links, use the in-game guidebook version, in the escape menu.[/bold][/color]

  [italic]RMC is a roleplaying game with team deathmatch elements. This means players are expected, to an extent, to pretend their character is part of this world in their actions and words. This is the intended experience, and the experience the players of RMC enjoy, and is not always about winning.[/italic]

  ## Recent Changes
  Read the relevant sections for the entire text.
  - [textlink="(Standard Operating Procedure)" link ="RMCMarineSOPNONModDeployment"] All civilian personnel, excluding recovered personnel [bold]require permission[/bold] from the Commander to deploy.
  - [textlink="(Standard Operating Procedure)" link ="RMCMarineSOPNONModDepartment"]  Equipment from personal job-specific vendors may not be awarded or otherwise handed out. See full text for details.
  - [textlink="(Standard Operating Procedure)" link ="RMCMarineSOPEquipment"]  Flashbangs may be carried on green, but only used in defense of self or others.
  - [textlink="(Survivor Roleplay)" link="RMCSurvivorRoleplay"] Survivors may no longer interact with intel objectives. See full text for exceptions.

  ## Admin Decisions Are Final.
  - Rules are enforced as intended. Every example of a rule break cannot be written, thus enforcement is subject to admin interpretation of the rule's intention.
  - Admins may handle rule breaks through in-character consequences at their discretion. This does not apply to zero tolerance rules, and rule breaks may not be requested to be handled this way.
  - Do not argue with the staff. You may file an appeal if you feel the decision to be incorrect, not ignore it.

  ## Important notes

  Heavily avoid using a VPN or any similar program to connect or while connected to RMC. You are putting your account at risk, which may result in your account being permanently banned.
  If you have a legitimate reason to use a VPN, you must attempt at least once to connect to the server without a VPN before requesting an exemption for it.

  ## General Information
  Disconnecting from or ignoring/evading admin-helps will result in action being taken.
  This is to prevent bad actors from avoiding issues. If you need to leave urgently, let us know and it will be considered in your appeal.
