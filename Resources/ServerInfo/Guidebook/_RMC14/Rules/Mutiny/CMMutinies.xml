  # Mutinies require admin permission.
  All players, including hostile forces, must obtain admin permission before engaging riots, mutinies or similar activity.
  - Strikes, revolutions, riots, cults, and any other type of similar largely disruptive behavior are strictly forbidden without permission.
  - Staff reserve the right to grant or deny mutinies, and to decide if the reason given is sufficient.
  - MPs are not able to mutiny and will always side with the acting commander, unless they are neutral, in which case they may not help or arrest either side until the mutiny is concluded.
  - Mutiny cannot occur during hijack, and any ongoing mutiny must be ended upon hijack.
  - Only the Acting Commander can be mutinied against. They must be given a chance to stand down peacefully.
  - During the mutiny, attacking any uninvolved, medical, or surrendered personnel is forbidden, as is perma-killing anyone involved.
  - If you have surrendered during a mutiny, you must remain as such.
  - You may not change sides unless you are surrendering.
  - Once concluded, all sides must be given medical treatment. Commanding Officers or higher are able to deny treatment or battlefield execute mutineers. The next in the command chain should be put in charge.
  - Mutinies must have 3 members minimum.
