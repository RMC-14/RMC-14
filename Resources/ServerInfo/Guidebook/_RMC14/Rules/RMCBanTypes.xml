  # Ban Types

  Bans can be appealed on the discord in the ban appeals section.

  ## Role Ban
  Also called a "job ban", this ban prevents your character from joining or late-joining a round as one or more jobs or roles. These are often used in response to problematic behavior in particular departments or address gross inexperience in important roles such as heads of staff. These bans do not mechanically prevent you from switching to the role during a round or acting as that role, but doing so is considered ban evasion.

  ## Game Ban
  Also called a "server ban", this ban prevents you from connecting to all RMC14 servers.

  # Ban Durations

  ## Temporary
  Temporary bans will be lifted automatically after a certain amount of time. If they are a game ban, they will tell you how much time is remaining when you try to connect.

  ## Indefinite
  These bans will only be removed on a successful appeal on the forums. Any ban which doesn't tell you when it expires and doesn't specify otherwise can be presumed to be an indefinite ban.

  ## Voucher
  This is an indefinite ban which may only be appealed both with a successful appeal and which require a voucher of good behavior from the administrative team of a well-known or at least decently active SS13/SS14 server in order for the appeal to be considered. Voucher bans typically cannot be appealed for at least six months after being issued. Without a voucher, a player can only attempt to appeal a voucher ban once, and only if the ban was inappropriately placed. Voucher bans are typically only placed as a result of an unsuccessful appeal of an indefinite game ban by players with a history of bans and of causing issues.

  ## Permanent
  This is a ban that is only appealable if the ban was inappropriately placed, including if the ban should not have been permanent. If the result of the appeal is that the ban was appropriately placed, the ban may not be appealed again and will not be lifted. These bans are extremely rare, but are applied to players who continually cause problems even after a voucher ban or users who have completely unacceptable behavior may be permanently removed.
