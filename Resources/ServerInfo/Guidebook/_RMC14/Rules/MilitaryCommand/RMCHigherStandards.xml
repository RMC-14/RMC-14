  These rules also apply to any individual who is promoted or is acting in the place of a MP/Command role (unless they are a member of a hostile force).\n[italic]Command roles are defined as; all heads, cic staff, mp, and squad leaders.[/italic]

  ## General Rules
  - [bold]Command must follow marine law[/bold], except if they are correctly part of a valid mutiny.
  - You may be rolebanned without warning.
  - Be competent in your job and department. Failure to know the basics of your department is liable to result in a job ban.

  - Do not abandon your position to do things unrelated to your role.
  - Do not immediately abandon the ship during a raid. Protect the ship and it's crew, don't let hostile forces kill everyone on it without a fight, and ensure they evacuate safely if needed.

  - You are expected to be able to communicate clearly and concisely when communicating on radio channels and announcements, and while in any professional setting.
