  # RMC-14 Rules

  [bold]If you are unable to click any links, use the in-game guidebook version, in the escape menu.[/bold]

  [italic]RMC is a roleplaying game with team deathmatch elements. This means players are expected, to an extent, to pretend their character is part of this world in their actions and words. This is the intended experience, and the experience the players of RMC enjoy, and is not always about winning.[/italic]

  ## Recent Changes
  Read the relevant sections for the entire text.

  - ([textlink="General Roleplay" link="CMGeneralRoleplayStandards"]) Some actions have no delay to make gameplay like reloading smoother. Do not abuse this to spam sounds.
  - ([textlink="General Roleplay" link="CMGeneralRoleplayStandards"]) Do not reference memes in character, on any faction, including substituting letters on a meme as a Xenonid.
  - ([textlink="Command" link="CMCommandRoleplay"], [textlink="Xenonid Queen" link="CMXenoRoleplay"]) Do not draw unrelated pictures or write unrelated things on the map.
  - ([textlink="Command" link="CMCommandRoleplay"], [textlink="Xenonid Queen" link="CMXenoRoleplay"]) Do not give medals/jellies sarcastically or as a joke. These are permanent awards on a player's account for doing well as a character and should have effort put into them.
  - ([textlink="Xenonid Queen" link="CMXenoRoleplay"]) You are expected to have a level of professionalism in the role, similar to the Executive Officer of the marines.
  - ([textlink="Survivor Roleplay" link="CMSurvivorRoleplay"]) Survivors should not engage or seek any xenonids before the roundstart xenos have had a chance to evolve (5 minutes). If a xenonid enters your vision, but you were not seeking them, you are free to attack them as they have forfeited their early round protection.
  - ([textlink="Xenonid Roleplay" link="CMXenoRoleplay"]) Avoid seeking out survivors at the start of the round as a larva. Leaving the protection of the hive will result in losing the 5 minute protection for yourself.
  - ([textlink="Mutinies" link="CMMutinies"]) Examples of invalid mutiny reasons.
  - ([textlink="Mutinies" link="CMMutinies"]) Mutinies must have 3 members minimum.

  ## Admin Decisions Are Final.
  - Rules are enforced as intended. Every example of a rule break cannot be written, thus enforcement is subject to admin interpretation of the rule’s intention.
  - Admins may handle rule breaks through in-character consequences at their discretion. This does not apply to zero tolerance rules.
  - You may file a staff complaint with head staff if you find the decision to be incorrect.

  ## General Information
  Disconnecting from or ignoring/evading admin-helps will result in an appeal only ban.
  This is to prevent bad actors from avoiding issues. If you need to leave urgently, let us know and it will be considered in your appeal.


  All of the below rules apply at all times, including between rounds.

  These rules are neither exactly SS14 or CM13 and should be read in their entirety.
