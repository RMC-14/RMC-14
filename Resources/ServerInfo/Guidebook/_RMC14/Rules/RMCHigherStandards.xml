  ## Command and MP are held to a higher standard.

  These rules also apply to any individual who is a MP/Command role (unless they are a member of a hostile force).\n[italic]Command roles are defined as; all heads, cic staff, MP, and squad leaders.[/italic]

  ## General Rules
  - [bold]Command roles must follow marine law[/bold], except if they are correctly part of a valid mutiny.
  - You may be rolebanned without warning.
  - Be competent in your job and department. Failure to know the basics of your department is liable to result in a job ban.
  - Do not willingly and openly cooperate with hostile forces.\nSome leeway is given to making deals with hostile forces if the deal benefits the safety or situation of the ship as a whole and not just yourself.
  - Do not abandon your position to do things unrelated to your role.
  - Do not immediately abandon the ship during a raid. Protect the ship and it's crew, don't let hostile forces kill everyone on it without a fight, and ensure they evacuate safely if needed.

  - You are expected to be able to communicate clearly and concisely when communicating on radio channels and announcements, and while in any professional setting.

  ## Command specific
  - Command are at minimum expected to report criminal activity to MP.

  ## MP Specific
  - MP is expected to intervene into criminal activity where possible, unless it conflicts with marine law.
  - The MP are not combat roles, and should focus solely on enforcing laws when planetside, if granted permission to do so.
