  # General roleplay standards


  ## Character memory
  - Your personal character may remember events that occured in previous missions and discuss them, but may not mention their own death or the death of another present character.
  - Marine specific knowledge can be found in [textlink="marine roleplay standards." link="RMCMarineRoleplayStandards"]

  ## Act like an actual character in this setting.
  - Do not use text speak or emoticons in character, and do not refer to out of character things like admins or rounds in-game.
  - Do not reference memes in character, on any faction, including substituting letters on a meme as a Xenonid.
  - Do not use emotes or local out of character to bypass speech filters or muteness.
  - You are not required to write a backstory; however, you are expected to at least make an effort to act like your role.
  - Some actions have no delay to make gameplay like reloading smoother. Do not abuse this to spam any kind of sounds.
  - Use [textlink="acceptable character names." link="RMCCharacterNames"]

  ## Suicides
  - You must have a valid roleplay reason to commit suicide.
  - Starting and then cancelling a suicide will be treated the same as an actual suicide, and also requires a valid reason.
  - Suiciding at round-end without a valid roleplay reason will be considered end-of-round grief and result in the same ban.

  [bold]If you are not sure if you have a valid reason, AHelp (F1) to ask.[/bold]

  [bold]Valid suicide examples:[/bold]
  - Suiciding as a survivor in a last stand scenario, when it is clear that you will be captured by xenonids and there is no hope of fighting back.
  - Suiciding to avoid being captured by a hostile force.
  - Suiciding if you fail to evac in a post-hijack evacuation of the Almayer.

  [bold]Not valid suicide examples:[/bold]
  - Suiciding at round end without a valid roleplay reason. Going out after a victory is not a valid reason.
  - Suiciding in briefing.
  - Suiciding to spite someone or because you want to stop playing the round.
  - Suiciding after receiving bad orders.
  - Suiciding at round-start because you didn't get the role you wanted.
  - Suiciding at memorial in remembrance of fallen marines.
  - Suiciding because you are wounded.

  ## Metagaming/Powergaming

  Some parts of the game cannot be covered by mechanics to ensure proper roleplay and balance.

  - Surrounding an objective structure such as towers or APCs entirely with reinforced walls to prevent Xenonids attacking it [bold]without T3s[/bold] is not allowed. This is usually only relevant in the early game.\nWalls can be used to cover most of the object, however there must remain access for other xenos IE barricades.\nThis rule is no longer applied as soon as a T3 Xenonid has been witnessed.
  - Xenonids also cannot surround an objective structure or APC entirely with walls, but can make an accessible room of it with a resin door. A room at minimum should have a tile of walkable space around the structure, with the spirit of the rule being that you are building a base that includes the structure, not encasing it in resin solely for out of character gameplay purposes.
  - Exploitation of any current game bugs. You can ask in ahelp if something is a bug to avoid this.

  [bold]Below is a list of common questions.[/bold]

  - Using an external program to calculate coordinate locations is permitted.
  - Xenonids may kill anyone, anywhere, for any reason, provided it is not detrimental to the hive. (i.e killing someone who could easily be infected, or is infected.)
