  # Xenonid roleplay standards

  ## General
  - The Queen may banish and/or devolve xenonids who do not follow these rules.
  - Xenonids enact the will of the Queen and must follow her orders.\nThe Queen may not force a xeno to a specific caste.
  - They are not, and may never be friendly to lifeforms that are potential hosts, or threaten the hive.
  - The exception to this are synthetics, which xenonids do not care for and can be ignored if safe to do so.
  - Banished xenonids are exempt from hive protection and may be killed. It should be announced for clarity.

  [italic]Avoid seeking out survivors at the start of the round as a larva. Evolve before searching for them and bring allies, because [color=#ff0000]you will no longer protected by the early round timer[/color] should you die because you have left the protection of the hive.[/italic]

  ## Killing
  - Xenonids may kill anyone, anywhere, for any reason, provided it is not detrimental to the hive. (i.e killing someone who could easily be infected, or is infected.)
  - Xenonids may only harm nested hosts if given explicit permission by the queen, or at their own risk of the above rule if the queen is unresponsive. (Reports of this from marines are less likely to be accurate.)

  ## Language and speech
  - Xenonid language is an english translation of their thoughts. They can define locations such as marine bases and ships, but do not know the names of them.
  - Do not spam the chat with noises.
  - Xenonids, due to the hivemind, learn everything and understand human equipment at a basic level.
  - They can understand a marine's role.
  - Xenonids can sense the marine ships and are aware they may be attacked shortly.

  ## Queen
  - Do not draw unrelated pictures or write unrelated things on the map.
  - Do not give jellies to xenonids sarcastically or as a joke. These are permanent awards on a player's account for doing well as a character and should have effort put into them.
  - You are expected to have a level of professionalism in the role, similar to the Executive Officer of the marines.


  If you are a xenonid attacking aboard a warship (Almayer), [color=#ff0000]attacking newly spawned players in hypersleep areas before hijack is forbidden, let them have a chance to gear up before you attack them![/color] Avoiding the hypersleep rooms unless the Marines are using them as cover will be enough.
