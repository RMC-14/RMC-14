  #Xenonid roleplay standards

  ##General
  - Xenonids enact the will of the Queen.
  - They are not, and may never be friendly.
  - The exception to this are synthetics, which xenonids do not care for and can be ignored if safe to do so.
  - The Queen may banish xenonids who do not follow these rules.
  - Banished xenonids are exempt from hive protection and may be killed.
  - Xenonids can use the hivemind to report drops.

  [italic]Avoid seeking out survivors at the start of the round as a larva. Evolve before searching for them and bring allies, because [color=#ff0000]you will no longer protected by the early round timer[/color] should you die because you have left the protection of the hive.[/italic]

  ##Language and speech
  - Xenonid language is an english translation of their thoughts. They can define locations such as marine bases and shuttles, but do not know the names of them.
  - Do not spam the chat with noises.
  - Xenonids, due to the hivemind, learn everything and understand human equipment at a basic level.
  - They can understand a marine's role.
  - Xenonids can sense the marine ships and are aware they may be attacked shortly.

  ## Queen
  - Do not draw unrelated pictures or write unrelated things on the map.
  - Do not give jellies to xenonids sarcastically or as a joke. These are permanent awards on a player's account for doing well as a character and should have effort put into them.
  - You are expected to have a level of professionalism in the role, similar to the Executive Officer of the marines.


  If you are a xenonid attacking aboard a warship (Almayer), [color=#ff0000]attacking newly spawned players in cryo before hijack is forbidden, let them have a chance to gear up before you attack them![/color] Avoiding the cryo rooms unless the Marines are using them as cover will be enough.
