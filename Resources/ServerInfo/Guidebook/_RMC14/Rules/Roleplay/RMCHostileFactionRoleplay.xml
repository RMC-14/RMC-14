  # Hostile Faction Roleplay Standards
  You do not have rules of engagement and may fire at and be hostile to Marine forces if:
  - You have not surrendered.
  - You have not accepted medical aid from the Marines, or been revived by them.\nYou may attempt to escape without combat and resume hostile activities when out of sight.
  - You have not changed your faction uniform.
  - You have remained hostile to Marine forces.\nPretending not be hostile will be counted as surrendering, unless it is for the sake of first contact negotiations which result in hostilities.

  [bold]Exceptions[/bold]

  - If captured, you may attempt to start a prison riot when in the brig, to escape and resume hostile intentions. This does not require permission if you are a hostile faction member.

  - If you are a hostile force attacking the Marines prior to hijack, [color=#ff0000]attacking newly spawned players in cryo is forbidden, let them have a chance to gear up before you attack them![/color] Avoiding the cryo rooms unless the Marines are using them as cover will be enough.
