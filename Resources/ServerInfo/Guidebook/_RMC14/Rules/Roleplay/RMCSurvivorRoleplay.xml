  #Survivor Roleplay Standards
  - Survivors have more leeway than marines with mental stability due to trauma experienced during the xenonid attack. They may be suffering PTSD, paranoia or similar conditions for roleplaying purposes.\nDespite this, survivors should not become hostile or cause drastic issues for the marines, such as stealing their secure equipment.
  - Standard survivors are not hostile to the Marines.
  - If there is an exception due to faction it will be clear.
  - Hostile Faction Survivors cannot attempt to harm other survivors.
  - [bold]Do not hunt, move, or secure monkeys to deny Xenonid captures. These monkeys lessen the amount of xenos at the start of the round, and make your life easier.[/bold]
  - Survivors should not engage or seek any xenonids before the roundstart xenos have had a chance to evolve (5 minutes). If a xenonid enters your vision, but you were not seeking them, you are free to attack them as they have forfeited their early round protection.
