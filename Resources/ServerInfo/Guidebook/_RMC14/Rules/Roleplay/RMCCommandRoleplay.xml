  # Command Roleplay Standards

  ## Briefing
  - A briefing must be conducted at the start of every operation before deployment.
  - The briefing must inform the squads of their orders, with the minimum personnel being the squad leaders.
  - Scouts Specialists and Intel officers are able to deploy before the operation begins if they have a personal briefing.

  ## General
  - Command must attempt to direct marines to build defenses to protect the primary landing zone.
  - When assigning a new warship commander, follow the [textlink="Commander Succession" link="RMCCommandChain"] whenever possible.
  - Do not draw unrelated pictures or write unrelated things on the tacmap.
  - Do not give medals to marines sarcastically or as a joke. These are permanent awards on a player's account for doing well as a character and should have effort put into them.
