  ## Community Rules (All OOC channels)

  - Per the hub rules of SS14, do not speak negatively of other SS14 servers, their community, or staff.

  - Be civil. No harassment/bullying or offensive/abusive/hate speech content that would make the game a hostile space. Avoid political topics.

  - Please do not start heated discussions, including balance issues or roleplay issues, as it is rarely productive with lack of context and information. Missing and new features/fixes and rules can be suggested in the features forum.

  - Do not discuss, complain, or comment about anyone's bans/notes including your own. If you've been banned or disagree with an action, the person involved must make an appeal in our appeals forum where a ruling can be made. It is otherwise assumed that the action is valid and there is no issue.
