  #So you've just been born into the hive!
  #Now what?

  - Rejoice! We've just joined our hive as a larva. We can't do very much right now, but our potential is limitless!

  - It's time to get to work! As soon as we can, we should try to evolve. This will require us to gain some age by waiting however.
  - For beginners, becoming a drone is recommended. Drones are responsible for building the hive defenses.

  - Here are a few of the things we can construct!

    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="WallXenoResin"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="WallXenoMembrane"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="DoorXenoResin"/>
  </Box>\n

  - Another important job of the Drone is to plant weeds.
  - Weeds allow us to rest to regain our health and energy!
  - We can also only construct the hive on weeds.

  - Our final goal is to protect the Queen and plant her eggs so our hive may grow!
  - Eggs can be placed on weeds, and contain parasites.
  - Parasites can be extracted from the eggs, but be wary that parasites have short lifespans away from the weeds!

    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="XenoEgg"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="XenoWeeds"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="CMXenoParasite"/>
  </Box>\n

  - When a parasite is placed on a living host, a new larva will be born! Rejoice!
  - Hosts that hold the growing larva are very precious, and should be secured to a resin wall as soon as possible.
