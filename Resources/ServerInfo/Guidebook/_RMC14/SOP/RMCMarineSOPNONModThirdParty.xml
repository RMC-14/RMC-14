  # NON-Modifiable Third-Party Regulations

  Marines are encouraged to recover any third-party personnel found in the [bold]Area of Operations[/bold].

  ## General

  - All recovered personnel must be searched on arrival by the [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color], with all weapons and unauthorized items secured within the brig. They may keep their tools provided they are not used for crime.
  - They should be given a medical examination if personnel are available.
  - Recovered personnel have the right to remain silent and must not be punished for invoking it.
  - [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color] are not required to detain civilian prisoners that are recovered.

  ## Military and Paramilitary

  - Third-party military or paramilitary personnel may be allowed to continue their operations if they prove beneficial or indifferent to UNMC interests. (This is also located in the [bold]Rules of Engagement[/bold])
  - They may be given permission to keep their weapons and equipment on the warship, provided they are beneficial to the operation.
  - They may also be denied access to the warship.

  ## Returning to the AO

  - Employed personnel are below all personnel in assigned departments, and must obey orders.

  [bold]Enlisting[/bold]
