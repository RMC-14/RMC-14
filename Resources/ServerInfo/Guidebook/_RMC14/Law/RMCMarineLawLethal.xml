  # Lethal Force
  - Lethal force should always remain a last resort.
  - During emergencies like mutinies, boardings, or when suspects have used lethal or disabling weapons against personnel, the [color=#8B0000][bold]Chief MP[/bold][/color] or [color=#008000][bold]Commander[/bold][/color] may authorize lethal force.
  - [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color] may use lethal force should suspects be an [bold]active[/bold] threat to the crew, ships, or the [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color]. The suspect should only be fired upon until they can no longer present any harm.
  - A suspect that has been detained and restrained must be kept safe from harm, as they are in [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color] custody.
  - If the [color=#8B0000][bold]Chief MP[/bold][/color] and [color=#008000][bold]Commander[/bold][/color] are not responding to comms within a reasonable amount of time, or are incapacitated, [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color] may use lethal force freely within reason, while on code red or higher.
  - [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color] may use lethal force against targets that are not affected by non-lethals attempts, such as synthetics.
