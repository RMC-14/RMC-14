  # Special Provisions

  ## MP Involvement in Mutinies
  - Attempting to overthrow the legitimate command staff is illegal, and [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color] must do everything in their power to prevent it.
  - Should a mutiny be successful, resulting in the [color=#008000][bold]Commander[/bold][/color] being deposed or surrendering, [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color] should hold the former [color=#008000][bold]Commander[/bold][/color] in indefinite confinement if their freedom would reignite the conflict.
  - The [color=#90EE90][bold]Duty Officer[/bold][/color] may be optionally skipped in the [textlink="Chain of Command" link="RMCCommandChain"], if the mutiny is successful.
  - MP will after resume normal operations with the new commander, and any subterfuge charges, sedition charges, insubordination charges, and ordered arrests in relation to the original commander must be dropped.

  ## Emergencies
  - In emergencies, such as significant boardings or a compromised brig, imprisoned personnel may be released by the [color=#8B0000][bold]Chief MP[/bold][/color], if they believe they will not be a further threat or hinderance during the emergency, also particularly if they display good behavior.
  - If the imprisoned are too dangerous or detrimental to the survival of the crew, they should be escorted to an escape pod by a commissioned officer or an [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color] who will maintain their safety.
  - A simple red alert is not sufficient reason for release, unless the ship is significantly overrun.
