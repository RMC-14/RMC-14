  # Non-Judicial Punishments (NJPs)
  These may be issued and observed by the [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color] or SEA instead of an arrest and/or brig sentence where valid.

  ## General usage
  - NJPs should not risk the person's health.
  - If the NJP offer is refused, they are to serve the original sentence, or a 10 minute brig timer if none exists.
  - Accepting the NJP waives the right to appeal. The suspect or prisoner should be informed of this.
  - Failure to comply to an [bold]accepted[/bold] NJP will result in an additional charge of [bold]resisting arrest[/bold] with the original charges.
  - Failure to complete an NJP is not considered failure to comply if a legitimate attempt is [bold]observed[/bold].
  - NJPs are a one-time offer. The same NJP for the charges cannot be accepted once denied.
  - The decision to offer or not offer a NJP may be overruled by a higher ranking [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color].
  - In the case of [bold]officer ordered arrests[/bold] the [color=#8B0000][bold]Chief MP[/bold][/color] or [color=#008000][bold]Commander[/bold][/color] may choose to assign an NJP over the initial charge (where valid).

  ## Brig usage
  - A NJP may be offered to a prisoner in a cell at any point, unless they were offered and denied one already, or their sentence total is above 10 minutes or a major crime.
  - NJPs cannot take longer than their remaining brig time.

  ## Examples
  - Ordering a marine to clean the preparation areas of squads.
  - Ordering a marine to do laps around the warship.
