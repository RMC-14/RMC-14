  # Arresting Procedures
  Should the warship get boarded by a hostile force, no arrests should be made unless the person presents a danger to the warship and/or its personnel.

  - Any orders given by any personnel who are legally detained or facing charges are considered void until the charges are cleared, the brig time is served, or the detention is resolved.
  - Always consider first if an arrest is actually needed to resolve a conflict. Arresting a doctor immediately for [bold]Neglect of Duty[/bold] will not make medical duties be performed more efficiently since they would be in the brig - but if they actually refuse to do their duties, then it would make sense to perform an arrest.

  ## Investigative Detainment
  Unless an investigation becomes an arrest, a suspect being investigated should not be moved away from their duties, such as the frontline, but should still be kept relatively safe.
  - [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color] may detain and physically restrain a suspect, with reasonable suspicion that they are involved in a crime, for up to 10 minutes to gather evidence and witness testimony.
  - This time used also carries over to an arrest, which will not grant an extra 10 minutes.
  - If these 10 minutes pass during the investigation, the suspect is to be immediately released if not found guilty of any crimes. If found guilty of crimes, they must still not be detained longer than 10 minutes, and be processed into arresting and charging procedure with reasonable speed.
  - If the suspect is found innocent of all accused crimes, the suspect should be released, and all investigations on this suspect being done by [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color] should be ended.
  - The [color=#8B0000][bold]Chief MP[/bold][/color] may order the release of a suspect under Investigative Detainment.
  - Fleeing an [bold]Investigative Detainment[/bold] is considered [bold]Resisting Arrest[/bold]

  ## Arresting a Suspect
  [italic]These arrests can be performed anywhere on the warship.[/italic]
  - Take down the Suspect if they resist and securely restrain them.
  - Move the Suspect to a holding cell.
  - Continue to [bold]charging procedure[/bold].
  - A suspect must be arrested and charged within 10 minutes. Any longer than this without good reason is considered [bold]Neglect of Duty[/bold] by whoever is most responsible for the delay.

  ## Arresting MP
  - The [color=#8B0000][bold]Chief MP[/bold][/color] can only be arrested if approved by the [color=#008000][bold]Commander[/bold][/color] or [color=#ffa500][bold]Provost Marshal Office[/bold][/color].
  - Any [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color]s can only be arrested if approved by the [color=#008000][bold]Commander[/bold][/color] or [color=#8B0000][bold]Chief MP[/bold][/color]. The [color=#008000][bold]Commander[/bold][/color] has the final say.
  - A [color=#90EE90][bold]Duty Officer[/bold][/color] is unable to authorise the arrest of an [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color] or the [color=#8B0000][bold]Chief MP[/bold][/color].
  - Ensure additional charging of Military Police procedure is followed.

  ## Actions Against the Commander
  - [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color] must contact [color=#ffa500][bold]Provost Marshal Office[/bold][/color] before taking any law-related actions against the [color=#00CBFE][bold]Commanding Officer[/bold][/color].
  - If there is no [color=#00CBFE][bold]Commanding Officer[/bold][/color], the [color=#008000][bold]Commander[/bold][/color] of the operation may be arrested, but [color=#ffa500][bold]Provost Marshal Office[/bold][/color] must be notified after the fact, through fax.


  ## Field Arrests
  [italic]These refer to arrests performed in the area of operations.[/italic]

  See [textlink="deployment of MP SOP" link="RMCMarineSOPNONModDeployment"] for information on deployment restrictions.

  - When required in the [bold]AO[/bold], [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color] should avoid combat whenever possible, and complete their tasks as quickly as they are able.
  - Field arrests are restricted to the [bold]FOB[/bold], dropships, and secure areas - but may also proceed past these locations with the approval of the [color=#8B0000][bold]Chief MP[/bold][/color] or [color=#00CBFE][bold]Commanding Officer[/bold][/color] with the intent of making an arrest or investigating a crime.
  - If a suspect flees outside the above allowed locations and are witnessed by a present [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color], they may be pursued without requiring approval.
  - If there are hostiles in the vicinity, the [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color] must attempt to move to a safer area, if attempting an arrest at this time would put the person or [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color] at risk, before attempting to continue the arrest.
  - [bold]Squad Leaders[/bold] may detain marines of their squad that violate the law or pose a risk to the safety of the squad. This may also apply to any shipside personnel that are deploying unauthorised. They may also task one of their squad members to escort the arrested person to a secure area or [bold]FOB[/bold] and wait for [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color] assistance.
  - Anyone detained by the [bold]Squad Leaders[/bold] should be passed onto the [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color] when possible.
  - [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color] may be required to transfer a prisoner from the [bold]AO[/bold] to the ship, and should, to the best of their ability, ensure the prisoner makes it to the ship safely.

  ## Victims May Drop Charges
  - Excluding capital crimes, [bold]Neglect of Duty[/bold], and grievous bodily harm, the victim of a crime retains the right to drop charges. More leeway for bodily harm may be granted while deployed, provided the harm done is mutually found accidental.
  - This is permitted after the defendant is moved to a secure location or the brig.
  - [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color] must release the defendant on the victim's request, with continued arrest attempts for the original crime being considered prevarication.
  - [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color] may hold the defendant for no longer than [bold]5 minutes[/bold] if they wish to contact [color=#ffa500][bold]Provost Marshal Office[/bold][/color] to appeal the arrest against the victim's wishes.
  - If an appeal to arrest from [color=#ffa500][bold]Provost Marshal Office[/bold][/color] is not received within the 5 minutes, the defendant must be released.


  ## Self Defense or Defense of Others
  Charges are not to be applied to those who use force on others when defending themselves from illegal harm, so long as they defend themselves with proportional force. This also extends to the defense of others if they believe the others are in lethal danger. This does not apply to lawful killings such as executions.


  The person being attacked should only use proportional lethal force until the person is no longer able to attack, and look to get away from the attacker where possible to alert the [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color]. The person being attacked should notify the [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color] or their supervisor about the use of self-defense.

  Examples of proportional force are;
  - Punching when being punched.
  - Melee weapons when being attacked with melee weapons.
  - Bullets against bullets.
