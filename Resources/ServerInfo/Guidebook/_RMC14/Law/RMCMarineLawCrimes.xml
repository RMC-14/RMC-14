  # Crimes

  ## Sprit of The Law
  The laws are intended to be interpreted by their spirit and not always necessarily their exact wording. Not all examples of crimes are listed. Always refer to the marine law rank structure if there is a disagreement on the interpretation of a law.

  ## On threats to break marine law
  - Threatening to commit a major or capital offense such as assault or murder (which would be treated as attempted murder) may be charged as such if there is a reasonable expectation and capability that the law will be broken.
  - Personnel with a weapon are more likely to commit this crime, where a threat from a confined prisoner can usually be considered meaningless.
  - History of crimes or actions may be taken into account.
