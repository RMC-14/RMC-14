  # Demotions

  ## General Procedure
  - A person who has been demoted is moved to a lower position in their department, or if no such position exists, a rifleman.
  - Demotions are limited to crimes where demotion is explicitly listed as an option, with the [color=#00CBFE][bold]Commanding Officer[/bold][/color] being able to do so freely if it fits the conditions of their provisions.
  - Permission must first be given by the head of the department responsible for the arrested person, unless the person performing the demotion is the [color=#00CBFE][bold]Commanding Officer[/bold][/color].
  - If the arrested person is a department head, the [color=#008000][bold]Commander[/bold][/color] must give the permission.
  - The [color=#008000][bold]Commander[/bold][/color] may turn any demotion to a termination instead, making the person a civilian. A [color=#90EE90][bold]Duty Officer[/bold][/color] does not have this permission.

  ## Riflemen Procedure
  - Riflemen who are demoted are to be discharged and treated as civilian passengers.
  - Their access to equipment should be restricted as such.

  ## MP Procedure
  - If they are of enlisted rank, they are to serve in squad roles, other assignments by permission of the Heads of departments, or direct assignment by the [color=#00CBFE][bold]Commanding Officer[/bold][/color].
  - If they are of Officer rank, they are to serve in CIC unless dismissed by the [color=#008000][bold]Commander[/bold][/color] to find duties elsewhere.
