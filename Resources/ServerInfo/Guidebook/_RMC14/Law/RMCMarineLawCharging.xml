  - Put them in the orange uniform, if available, else their original uniform.
  - Give them a standard headset of common channel, if available.

  - Search their belongings for contraband and theft.
  - When the time is over, let them grab their belongings, escort them out of the brig.
  - If the prisoner is SSD at the end of their sentence, return their belongings and place them in brig cryo.
  - If a prisoner has been SSD for over 5 minutes you may place them in cryo, but they must serve the rest of their time if they return.

  ## Medical Experiments
  A prisoner may waive their rights to participate in medical experiments. Researchers performing approved medical experiments  may not be held liable for damages inflicted on the subject within the approved parameters of the experiment.
  - All experiments require the signed (or stamped) approval of either the [color=#008000][bold]Commander[/bold][/color] (But not [color=#90EE90][bold]Duty Officer[/bold][/color]) or the CMO.
  - Prisoners can request to be used as subjects. The prisoner's brig time must continue to run while they are being used, and are free to go when it expires and are not obligated to continue.
  - Medical experiments that will result in death must only be offered to prisoners who are to be executed, or if execution is one of the listed punishment options for their crime. It is otherwise illegal, and will result in a [bold]Attempted Murder[/bold], or [bold]Murder[/bold] charge where relevant.
