  # Marine Law

  Marine law and SOP applies to all personnel in the vicinity of the operation or aboard the UNMC warship, including hostile factions and other organizations not explicitly exempt.

  ## Basics

  - Command and [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color] are required to both enforce the law and abide by it, where allowed by their position on the ship.
  - On UNMC warships and operations, the law is enforced by the [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color]s and [color=#8B0000][bold]Chief MP[/bold][/color], and they operate independently from the normal command structure ONLY in matters related to the enforcement of the Law.
  - The [color=#00CBFE][bold]Commanding Officer[/bold][/color] of the warship has the final say on law enforcement within their operational area unless overseen by higher officials of the [color=#ffa500][bold]Provost Marshal Office[/bold][/color] or High Command.
  - [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color] may, at their discretion, ignore Minor Crimes unless they are ordered to enforce one.
  - [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color] cannot be ordered to ignore Minor Crimes.
  - [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color] breaking the law in any capacity cannot be ignored.

  Should [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color]s disagree on cases, Marine Law rank structure must be followed.

  - [color=#ffa500][bold]Provost Marshal Office[/bold][/color] > [color=#00CBFE][bold]Commanding Officer[/bold][/color] > [color=#8B0000][bold]Chief MP[/bold][/color] > [bold]Warden[/bold] > [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color] > Deputized [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color]
