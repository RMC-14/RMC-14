  # Marine Law

  Marine Law and SOP applies to all personnel in the vicinity of the operation or aboard the UNMC warship, including hostile factions and other organizations not explicitly exempt.

  The goal of [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color] is to make the ship a safer and productive place for everyone. Do your best to uphold that goal, by mediating conflicts and assisting the crew and marines with their needs, using the minimal force required.

  Always consider first if an arrest is actually needed to resolve a conflict. Arresting a doctor immediately for [bold]Neglect of Duty[/bold] will not make medical duties be performed more efficiently since they would be in the brig - but if they actually refuse to do their duties, then it would make sense to perform an arrest.

  ## Basics

  - Command and [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color] are required to both enforce the law and abide by it, where allowed by their position on the ship.
  - On UNMC warships and operations, the law is enforced by the [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color]s and [color=#8B0000][bold]Chief MP[/bold][/color], and they operate independently of the normal command structure ONLY in matters related to the enforcement of the Law.
  - The [color=#00CBFE][bold]Commanding Officer[/bold][/color] of the warship has the final say on law enforcement within their operational area unless overseen by higher officials of the [color=#ffa500][bold]Provost Marshal Office[/bold][/color] or High Command.
  - [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color] may, at their discretion, warn, or NJP a person guilty of Minor Crimes, as well as ignore Minor Crimes. This can be done in place of applying a brig punishment, but these lesser actions should be avoided for repeat offenders.
  - [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color] cannot be ordered to ignore Minor Crimes.
  - [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color] breaking the law in any capacity cannot be ignored.

  Should [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color]s disagree on cases, Marine Law rank structure must be followed.

  - [color=#ffa500][bold]Provost Marshal Office[/bold][/color] > [color=#00CBFE][bold]Commanding Officer[/bold][/color] > [color=#8B0000][bold]Chief MP[/bold][/color] > [bold]Warden[/bold] > [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color] > Deputized [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color]
