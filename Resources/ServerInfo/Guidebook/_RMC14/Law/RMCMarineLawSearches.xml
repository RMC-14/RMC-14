  # Searches

  - Searches must be approved by the [color=#8B0000][bold]Chief MP[/bold][/color] or [color=#008000][bold]Commander[/bold][/color].
  - If waiting would cause further harm to the ship or personnel, you may gain approval after performing the search.
  - Searches can be performed by the [color=#008000][bold]Commander[/bold][/color] or any [color=#ff000d][bold]MP[/bold][/color], as long as the following procedure is followed.
  - If procedure is not followed, the offender can be charged with [bold]Neglect of Duty[/bold].
  - Searches cannot incur a [bold]Prevarication[/bold] charge should no illegal items be found.

  ## Personnel
  - Inform the person you are going to conduct a search and the reason for the search.
  - Use non-lethal force to restrain them if they do not comply.
  - Where possible, conduct the search in the brig or any isolated area so nothing is stolen.
  - Begin the search, confiscate any illegal items, and secure them.
  - If the items warrant a sentence, follow arrest and brig procedures, otherwise release the personnel.
  - Items that are no longer needed for evidence can be returned to requisitions.


  ## Areas
  - State your intent to search the area, then vacate it of any personnel unrelated to the search.
  - If someone responsible for the area is available at the area, inform them of the reason.
  - If nobody with access to the area is present, request trained personnel to temporarily override the doors.
  - If you cannot gain access to the area, and no personnel can override the doors, forceful entry may be performed. (Personnel with access in the area will be liable for the [bold]reasonable[/bold] damage to the ship.)
  - Search and secure any evidence.
  - Restore the searched area to its previous state as closely as possible.
  - Reopen the area to normal traffic, then move all evidence to brig for processing.
  - Items that are no longer needed for evidence can be returned to requisitions.
