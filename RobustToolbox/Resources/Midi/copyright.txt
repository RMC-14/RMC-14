fallback.sf2 is a modified version of https://musical-artifacts.com/artifacts/806
The original was created by: stgiga, Cirnopez/Cirnomiji/Pezbeth, Zmey Kolbasnik, and Elf of Happy and Love/StarDream Studios, and also formerly Zandro Reville and Gashisoft
It was then modified by 20kdc to:
 1. add more instruments, though also to remove the 'high' presets as they are basically never used,
 2. and to remove presets which just alias to Piano anyway
