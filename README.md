RMC-14 is an asymmetric game, that runs on [Robust Toolbox](https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolbox). It is inspired by [CMSS13](https://github.com/cmss13-devs/cmss13), [Space Station 13](https://spacestation13.com/).

This is the primary repo for RMC-14. To prevent people forking Robust Toolbox, a "content" pack is loaded by the client and server. This content pack contains everything needed to play the game on one specific server.

If you want to host or create content for RMC-14, this is the repo you need. It contains both RobustToolbox and the content pack for development of new content packs.
