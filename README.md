RMC-14 is inspired by CM13, Space Station 13, that runs on [Robust Toolbox](https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolbox).

The design goal of this fork is to attempt to replicate the feel and experience of CM13, while using SS14 as a foundation.

This is the primary repo for RMC-14. To prevent people forking Robust Toolbox, a "content" pack is loaded by the client and server. This content pack contains everything needed to play the game on one specific server.

If you want to host or create content for RMC-14, this is the repo you need. It contains both RobustToolbox and the content pack for development of new content packs.
